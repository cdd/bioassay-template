Common methods include a plaque formation assay (PFA), focus forming assay (FFA), which yield results of plaque or focus forming units per ml (pfu or ffu/ ml), or endpoint dilution assay (TCID50, which measures the amount of virus needed to kill 50% 0of infected hosts or cells).  TCID50 and pfu/ml results are not equivalent."

It is used as an in vitro model of passive, transcellular permeation to predict oral absorption. PAMPA is an alternative to the cell-based Caco-2 permeability assay: Caco-2 uses compartments of different volumes separated by a monolayer of cells grown on a filter. PAMPA, however, uses chambers of the same size, separated by a filter coated with lipid in organic solvent."
