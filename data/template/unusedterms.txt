http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000001 : 'fluorescence resonance energy transfer'
    Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is based on the transfer of energy between two fluorophores, a donor and an acceptor, when in close proximity. The energy transfer is directed from higher-energy donor fluorophore to lower-energy acceptor fluorophore of labeled protein pairs. Target protein pairs are likely to exhibit FRET if they are no more than 10 nm apart.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000002 : 'homogeneous time resolved fluorescence'
    Homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) is a technology which combines standard FRET technology with the time-resolved measurement of fluorescence. Through this, HTRF eliminates the short-lived background fluorescence. Introducing a time delay (50-150 micro seconds) between the system excitation and fluorescence measurement, which allows the signal to be cleared of all non-specific short lived emissions.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000003 : 'fluorescence polarization'
    Fluorescence polarization (FP) measurements are based on the assessment of the rotational motions of species. It is used to measure binding interactions. When linear polarized light is used to excite fluorophores, only those aligned with the plane of polarization will be excited. For fluorophores attached to small, rapidly rotating molecules, the initially photoselected orientational distribution becomes randomized prior to emission, resulting in low fluorescence polarization. But binding of the low molecular weight tracer to a large, slowly rotating molecule results in high fluorescence polarization.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000004 : 'time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer'
    Time resolved-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) unites TRF (Time-Resolved Fluorescence) and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) principles. This combination brings together the low background benefits of TRF with the homogeneous assay format of FRET. Introducing a time delay (50-150 micro seconds) between the system excitation and fluorescence measurement allows the signal to be cleared of all non-specific short lived emissions. TR-FRET uses lanthanide donors which are fluorophores with long emission half-lives.
    

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000005 : 'flow cytometry'
    Flow cytometry uses the principles of light scattering and fluorescence from fluorochrome molecules to generate specific multi-parameter data from particles and cells in the size range of 0.5um to 40um diameter.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000006 : 'percent cytotoxicity'
    It is a measure of the number of dead cells in a culture well. We consider it as a subclass of 'percent inhibition', because cell death is induced by inhibition of vital cellular processes and percent cytotoxicity increases as the number of dead cells increases.  It can be estimated in the compound treated wells in comparison to vehicle-treated control wells and is expressed as a percent. The compound treatment is preferably performed in a short window of time to avoid masking the effect due to cell proliferation.
Compound cytotoxicity is an important parameter to measure when developing potential human therapeutics. Cytotoxicity is determined as a measure of radioisotope (3H thymidine or 51Cr) release, lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells, tetrazolium salt and alamar blue reduction, fluorescent dyes that selectively stain live or dead cells, and decrease in ATP content. ATP levels are detected using a luminescence based assay kit such as CellTiter-Glo (Promega). ATP values higher than controls indicate proliferation and cultures with ATP concentrations lower than controls indicate cytotoxicity.

Percent cytotoxicity = 100-percent viability

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000029 : 'assay screening campaign stage'
    The assay stage describes the purpose of the assay in an assay campaign.  Assay stage also relates to the order of assays in a screening campaign.  For example the primary assay, which is performed first, identifies hits. The primary hits are then confirmed in a confirmatory assay.  Subsequent secondary assays are run to eliminate compounds that are not of interest or to confirm hits using an alternate design / technology, or to further characterize compounds.
Whether an assay is run in single concentration or concentration response is defined in the class 'assay measurement throughput quality'.  For example primary assays are typically run in single concentration with single measurements. However, the NCGC runs qHTS primary assays as concentration-response assays.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000034 : 'Kd'
    Kd – is the equilibrium dissociation constant for a drug.  It describes the affinity between a ligand (L) (such as a drug) and a protein (P). Ligand-protein affinities are influenced by non-covalent intermolecular interactions between the two molecules such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic and Van der Waals forces. 
Kd = ([P] [L]) / [PL]
The dissociation constant has molar units (M), which corresponds to the concentration of ligand [L] at which the binding site on a particular protein is half occupied, i.e. the concentration of ligand, at which the concentration of protein with ligand bound [PL], equals the concentration of protein with no ligand bound [P]. The smaller the dissociation constant, the more tightly bound the ligand is, or the higher the affinity between ligand and protein. http://www.graphpad.com/curvefit/law_of_mass_action.htm

    Chemiluminescence is the generation of light as a result of a chemical reaction using synthetic compounds and usually involving a highly oxidized species such as peroxide.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000054 : 'surface plasmon resonance'
    For surface plasmon resonance measurements, target protein is immobilized onto a solid surface via covalent or noncovalent interaction. Binding of small molecule compounds changes the refractive index of the immobilized target, which can be detected by optical sensing. Shift in wavelength of light is proportional to mass changes near the sensor surface, with sensitivity to detect mass change being ~300 Da.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000055 : 'mass spectrometry'
    This method is used to detect compounds that are bound to the protein targets. The unbound compounds are separated by affinity based, size exclusion, or ultrafiltration methods. The bound compounds are eluted from the protein and detected by mass spectrometry. Based on the separation method, the throughput varies: between 200-2700 compounds can be loaded in each run for separation.
Mass spectrometry is used to determine the chemical structure of molecules. The samples are vaporized, followed by ionization and then the mass to charge ratio of the particles is analyzed.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000057 : 'optical based'
    These biosensors employ evanescent waves (surface plasmon resonance, resonant waveguide grating) or interference of light waves to characterize the cellular processes that are taking place at or near the sensor surface: e.g.  to study the affinity of a sample to the biological receptors immobilized on the sensor surface.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000058 : 'thermal shift'
    Upon heating, a protein unfolds and loses the native conformation. Binding of a small molecule can often stabilize the protein conformation, resulting in a higher unfolding temperature. The temperature shift in unfolding can be detected using a fluorescent dye, which is sensitive to the protein environment.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000060 : 'current clamp'
    The current clamp technique is used to measure biological voltages such as the action potential of an excitable cell with a microelectrode while keeping electrical current through the recording electrode constant. It can be used for both extracellular and intracellular recordings.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000061 : 'impedance'
    Impedance biosensors measure the electrical opposition of an interface in AC steady state with constant DC bias conditions. This is accomplished by imposing a small sinusoidal voltage at a particular frequency and measuring the resulting current; the process can be repeated at different frequencies. The current-voltage ratio gives the impedance.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000062 : 'patch clamp'
    The patch clamping technique is refined from the voltage clamp technique, wherein a blunt electrode is placed on the surface of the cell membrane. It is a common intracellular recording technique in electrophysiology that allows either the measurement of current passing through individual ion channels in cells or through whole cells. Suction is applied via the blunt electrode (glass pipette in classical patch clamp technique) to create a high resistance (gigaohm) between the electrode and cell surface. This seal isolates the ion channels within the patch from the rest of the membrane and allows the neurophysiologist to record only from these ion channels.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000063 : 'voltage clamp'
    The voltage clamp technique is used to measure the ion currents across an excitable cell membrane, such as neuronal membrane, while holding the membrane voltage at a constant level. The neuronal membrane contains different kinds of ion channels including voltage gated ion channels. Manipulation of the membrane voltage using voltage clamping allows the current-voltage relationships of these ion channels to be studied.

    This technique probes the surface of fluorescently-labeled living cells with an evanescent wave generated by a light beam traveling between two media of differing refractive indices. An incident laser beam is reflected at a critical angle (total internal reflection) when it encounters the interface between a microscope glass slide and the aqueous medium containing the cells.  Only fluorophores which are within a few nanometers of the surface are excited, while those farther away are not, making possible the study the interactions at the cell surface.

In this technique, the interference pattern of white light reflected from two surfaces: a layer of immobilized protein on the biosensor tip, and an internal reference layer are analyzed. Changes in the number of molecules bound to the biosensor tip cause a shift in the interference pattern, which can be measured in real-time.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000067 : 'fiber optic waveguide'
    It is based on the ability of a transparent substance, such as glass to conduct some of the visible or near-visible light to its interior by means of internal reflection.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000068 : 'optical waveguide grating'
    The optical grating coupler sensor responds to the change of optical refractive index of the liquid or gas cover medium and to the adsorption or binding of molecules on the surface. The optical grating coupler sensor chip is based on a fine optical grating prepared on a thin waveguide layer carried by a glass substrate. The optical grating couples the light of a He-Ne laser at a given resonance angle into the waveguide layer. This incoupling angle is very sensitive to the presence of adsorbed molecules and to any change of refractive index of the medium covering the surface of the chip. By precise measurement of the incoupling angle, the amount of the adsorbed material can be determined with ultra high sensitivity.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000069 : 'resonant waveguide grating'
    Cells are directly cultured onto the surface of a resonant waveguide grating (RWG) biosensor. The mass redistribution within the bottom portion of cells, mediated by stimulus is directly measured with the biosensor. RWG biosensor utilizes an optical beam with an appropriate angular content to illuminate a waveguide film in which a grating structure is embedded. When this beam is reflected by the sensor surface, the resonant angle dominates in the output beam. The mass redistribution within the sensing volume alters the incident angle. Because of its ability for multiparameter measurements, the biosensor has potential to provide high information content for cell sensing. These parameters include the angular shift (one of the most common outputs), the intensity, the peak width at half-maximum (PWHM), and area of the resonant peaks.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000070 : 'absorbance'
    The absorbance of a beam of collimated monochromatic radiation in a homogeneous isotropic medium is proportional to the absorption path length and to the concentration of the absorbing species. Absorbance is a logarithmic measure of the amount of light (at a specific wavelength) that is absorbed when passing through a sample.  A= -log10(I/I0), where A is absorbance, I is the intensity of incident light and I0 is the intensity of light transmitted after passing through the sample.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000071 : 'transmittance'
    The transmittance of a sample is the ratio of the intensity of the light that has passed through the sample to the intensity of the light when it entered the sample (T = Iout / Iin ).

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000073 : 'phospholipid redistribution estimation'
    In a viable cell, the phospholipid, phosphatidyl serine (PS) is localized on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane facing the cytosol. When the cell is undergoing apoptosis, the cell membrane loses its phospholipid asymmetry and exposes PS on the outer layer of the membrane. Annexin V specifically binds PS. Hence, apoptotic cells can be detected by staining with FITC conjugated Annexin V followed by flow cytometry.

    The role of a chemical compound or reagent used in each plate of an assay to normalize the response of the test perturbagens (by plate). Compounds that can have a positive control role are known from previous experiments or is a previously established standard.  It is usually highly active resulting in a strong response of the intended effect.  In an inhibition assay the positive control would usually result in the complete inhibition, which is then used for normalization (i.e. set as 100%). In an activation assay it would be activator used to normalize activity. Using controls provides an external reference and reduces the number of false negatives and false positives.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000401 : 'filter assay'
    This assay is performed to study interaction between a radio-labeled ligand and the receptor. The reaction mixture containing the receptor and radioligand is transferred to a filter plate, washed to remove the unbound radioligand. The bound complex remains on the filter, which can be eluted into the scintillation fluid and the radioactivity measured. Filter assays differ from SPA because a separation of free radioligand and radioligand bound to the receptor is required for measurement.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000402 : 'radioligand binding method'
    It is used for analysis of receptor-ligand interactions in screening applications. It utilizes a radiolabeled ligand and a source of receptor (membranes, soluble/purified).

    It involves the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into uniform distribution with a liquid medium capable of converting the kinetic energy of nuclear emissions into light energy. A scintillation counter is used to measure ionizing radiation. The scintillation counter consists of a sensor, called a scintillator, made of transparent crystal or an organic liquid that fluoresces when struck by ionizing radiation. A photomultiplier is then used to measure the light emitted by the sensor and is attached to an electronic apparatus that amplifies and quantifies the radiation signal.

    The B score is an analog of the Z score, but is more resistant to the presence of outliers and to differences in the measurement error distributions of the compounds. It is calculated by first computing a two-way median to account for row and column effects of the plate,  which is then divided by their median absolute deviation to standardize for plate-to-plate variability.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000431 : 'percent control normalization'

    A competitive inhibitor binds only to free enzyme. Often this binding event occurs on the active site of the target, precisely where substrate also binds. It will raise the apparent KM value for its substrate with no change in the apparent Vmax value. As a result, competitive inhibition can be overcome, observed by an increase in the apparent KI value, at higher concentrations of substrate.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000483 : 'uncompetitive inhibition'
    An uncompetitive inhibitor binds exclusively to the enzyme-substrate complex yielding an inactive enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. When encountered, the apparent Vmax value and the apparent KM value should both decrease.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000485 : 'non-competitive inhibition'
    A noncompetitive inhibitor binds equally well to both free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. These binding events occur exclusively at a site distinct from the precise active site occupied by substrate.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000490 : 'tight binding inhibition'
    In this type of inhibition, the population of free, soluble inhibitor is significantly depleted by the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor or enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. While tight-binding inhibitors can bind to the target enzyme in a competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive manner with respect to substrate binding, they can display noncompetitive phenotypes.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000491 : 'time dependent inhibition'
    Time-dependent inhibitors bind slowly to the enzyme on the time scale of enzymatic turnover, and thus display a change in initial velocity with time. This has the effect of slowing the observed onset of inhibition.

    In molecular biology, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique to amplify a single or few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. The method relies on thermal cycling, consisting of cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region along with a DNA polymerase (after which the method is named) are key components to enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is exponentially amplified.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002415 : 'dot immunobinding assay'
    Dot immunobinding assay (Dot Iba) is a simple and highly reproducible immunodiagnostic method. Antibody or antigen is dotted directly onto nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) discs. The diagnostic material to be checked can be incubated on this disc. Presence of antigen antibody complex in NCM discs can be directly demonstrated with enzyme-conjugated antiglobulins and substrate. Development of a purple-pink colored, insoluble substrate product in the NCM will be considered a positive result in the assay. This assay allows the processing of multiple specimens at a time.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002418 : 'dilution method'
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002419 : 'enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay'
    The ELISPOT assay is based on, and was developed from a modified version of the ELISA immunoassay. ELISPOT assays were originally developed to enumerate B cells secreting antigen-specific antibodies, and have subsequently been adapted for various tasks, especially the identification and enumeration of cytokine-producing cells at the single cell level. Simply put, at appropriate conditions the ELISPOT assay allows visualization of the secretory product of individual activated or responding cells. Each spot that develops in the assay represents a single reactive cell. Thus, the ELISPOT assay provides both qualitative (type of immune protein) and quantitative (number of responding cells) information.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002420 : 'fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay'
    Fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) is a technique where a fluorescent probe is used on an antibody of interest, which results in direct detecting fluorescence intensity instead of more complicated enzymatic reaction. Compared with the sandwich ELISA, FLISA has similar sensitivity and specificity, but it is much more rapid, economic and convenient.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002421 : 'sandwich ELISA'
    The sandwich ELISA measures the amount of antigen between two layers of antibodies. The antigens to be measured must contain at least two antigenic sites, capable of binding to antibody, since at least two antibodies act in the sandwich. So sandwich assays are restricted to the quantitation of multivalent antigens such as proteins or polysaccharides. Sandwich ELISAs for quantitation of antigens are especially valuable when the concentration of antigens is low and/or they are contained in high concentrations of contaminating protein.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002422 : 'immunoblot'
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002423 : 'in-cell western assay'
    The In-Cell Western Assay is an immunocytochemical assay that uses NIR fluorescence to detect and quantify proteins in fixed cells. Detecting proteins in their cellular context increases quantification precision. Proteins in fixed, cultured cells are detected directly in microplates, which yields higher throughput compared to Western blotting and eliminates typical Western blotting steps such as cell lysate preparation, electrophoresis, and membrane transfer. Using the In-Cell Western Assay kits, the cost per well for secondary screening is reduced to a fraction of the cost of typical western blots.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002424 : 'western blot'
    The western blot (alternatively, protein immunoblot) is an analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in a given sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate native or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide (denaturing conditions) or by the 3-D structure of the protein (native/ non-denaturing conditions). The proteins are then transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are probed (detected) using antibodies specific to the target protein.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002425 : 'immunolabeling method'
    Immunolabeling is a means of localizing particular antigens within tissue. Immunolabeling is a methodological process where: 1) antibodies are used to identify antigens within an organism and 2) a tag (e.g. through fluorescence, gold beads, epitope tag, etc.) is added to a secondary antibody which binds to the primary antibody.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002426 : 'immunofluorescent labeling'
    Immunofluorescence is the labeling of antibodies or antigens with fluorescent dyes.

http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002432 : 'gene knock in'
    A Knock-in refers to a genetic engineering method that involves the insertion of a protein coding cDNA sequence at a particular locus in an organism's chromosome. The difference between knock-in technology and transgenic technology is that a knock-in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus, and is a "targeted" insertion.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002433 : 'gene knockdown'
    Gene knockdown refers to techniques by which the expression of one or more of an organism's genes is reduced, either through genetic modification (a change in the DNA of one of the organism's chromosomes) or by treatment with a reagent such as a short DNA or RNA oligonucleotide with a sequence complementary to either an mRNA transcript or a gene.
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002434 : 'gene knockdown by RNA interference'
    Double-stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Using this mechanism, researchers can cause a drastic decrease in the expression of a targeted gene.

    A biosafety level is the level of biocontainment required to isolate hazardous biological agents in an enclosed facility. The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level of 1 to the highest at level 4.

The levels are as follows:

BSL1:
 Suitable for work involving well-characterized agents not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment (definition from CDC).

BSL2:
Suitable for work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and the environment. It differs from BSL-1 in that 1) laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures; 2) access to the laboratory is restricted when work is being conducted; and 3) all procedures in  which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in BSCs or other physical containment equipment (definition from CDC).

BSL3:
Suitable for clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or production facilities where work is performed with indigenous or exotic agents that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation route exposure. Laboratory personnel must receive specific training in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents, and must be supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures. All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious materials must be conducted within BSCs, other physical containment devices, or by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (definition from CDC).

BSL4:
