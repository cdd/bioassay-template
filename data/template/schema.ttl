The process ends when the cell has died. The process is divided into a signaling pathway phase, and an execution phase, which is triggered by the former." ;

Cytotoxicity can be determined for example as a measure of radioisotope (3H thymidine or 51Cr) release, lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells, tetrazolium salt and alamar blue reduction, fluorescent dyes that selectively stain live or dead cells,  or decrease in ATP content. ATP levels are detected using a luminescence based assay kit such as CellTiter-Glo (Promega). ATP values higher than controls (untreated cells) indicate proliferation and cultures with ATP concentrations lower than controls indicate cytotoxicity.\n" ;

It can be estimated in the compound treated wells in comparison to vehicle-treated control wells and is expressed as a percent. The compound treatment is preferably performed in a short window of time to avoid masking the effect due to cell proliferation.\nCompound cytotoxicity is an important parameter to measure when developing potential human therapeutics. Cytotoxicity is determined as a measure of radioisotope (3H thymidine or 51Cr) release, lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells, tetrazolium salt and alamar blue reduction, fluorescent dyes that selectively stain live or dead cells, and decrease in ATP content. ATP levels are detected using a luminescence based assay kit such as CellTiter-Glo (Promega). ATP values higher than controls indicate proliferation and cultures with ATP concentrations lower than controls indicate cytotoxicity.\n\nPercent cytotoxicity = 100-percent viability" ;

Simply put, at appropriate conditions the ELISPOT assay allows visualization of the secretory product of individual activated or responding cells.

The method relies on thermal cycling, consisting of cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region along with a DNA polymerase (after which the method is named) are key components to enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is exponentially amplified." ;
