Cytotoxicity can be determined for example as a measure of radioisotope (3H thymidine or 51Cr) release, lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells, tetrazolium salt and alamar blue reduction, fluorescent dyes that selectively stain live or dead cells,  or decrease in ATP content. ATP levels are detected using a luminescence based assay kit such as CellTiter-Glo (Promega).

Membranes (12âˆ’14 kDa A cutoff) were conditioned\nin deionized water for 60 min, followed by conditioning in 80:20\ndeionized water:ethanol for 20 min and then rinsed in artificial\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before use.

Thawed brain\ntissue was homogenized with artificial CSF to a final composition of 1:2\nbrain:artificial CSF using a Covaris S2 (KBiosciences, Hoddesdon, UK).\nDiluted brain homogenate was spiked with the test compound (10 ug/\ng), and 150 Î¼L aliquots (n = 6 replicate determinations) loaded into the\n96-well equilibrium dialysis plate.

Sample extraction was performed by the\naddition of 400 Î¼L of acetonitrile containing an appropriate internal\nstandard. Samples were allowed to mix for 1 min and then centrifuged at\n1825g in 96-well blocks for 10 min (Allegra X12-R, Beckman Coulter,\nUSA). All samples were analyzed by means of UPLC/MS/MS on a\nQuattro Premier XE mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, USA).\nThe unbound fraction was determined as the ratio of the peak area in\nartificial CSF to that in brain, with correction for dilution factor\naccording to eq 1." ;

The inhibitors\nwere then added from stock solutions in DMSO to the desired final\nconcentration and cells were further incubated for 20 h. Cells were\nlysed in SDS lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS). Samples\nwere sonicated and cleared by centrifugation before SDSâˆ’PAGE and\nimmunoblotting with a goat antibody for GFP (no. 600-101-215,\nRockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) and a phosphorylation\nstate specific antibody directed against pThr212 in the tau\nprotein (no. 44740G, Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA). Immunoreactivities\nwere detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using HRPcoupled\nsecondary antibodies and quantified using the AIDA Image\nAnalyzer 5.0 program (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Relative tau\nphosphorylation was calculated by normalization to total tau\nexpression, as determined from GFP immunoreactivity. To calculate\nrelative DYRK1A activity, the basal pT212 signal in control cells not\ntreated with doxycyclin was subtracted from all values, and the\nphosphorylation in DYRK1A expressing cells not treated with\ninhibitors was set to 100%.

HEK 293T, HFF and A549 cell lines were obtained\nfrom American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).\nMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 cell lines were obtained\nfrom Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI). The cells were maintained in DMEM (Life\nTechnologies, Grand Island, NY) with nonessential amino acids\n(Life Technologies) and 10% (v/v) HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS,\nGE Healthcare Life Science, Logan, UT) at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2.\nHMEC cells were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MA) and were\ncultured in MEGM complete media (Lonza) supplemented with 10\nÎ¼g/mL penicillin and 10 Î¼g/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies) at\n37 Â°C under 5% CO2.\nInhibition of CREB-Mediated Gene Transcription. HEK 293T\ncells in a 10 cm plate were transfected with pCRE-RLuc (6 Î¼g) with\nLipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) following the manufacturerâ€™s\ninstructions. Three hours after transfection, the cells were collected\nand replated into 96-well plates at âˆ¼10 000 cells/well. The cells were\nallowed to attach to the bottom of the plates overnight. The cells were\nthen treated with different concentrations of different compounds for\n30 min, when forskolin (10 Î¼M) was added to each well. The cells\nwere incubated for further 5 h before cell lysis using 1Ã— 30 Î¼L Renilla\nluciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). An amount of 5 Î¼L of\nthe lysate was combined with 30 Î¼L of benzyl-coelenterazine\n(Nanolight, Pinetop, AZ) solution in PBS (pH 7.4, 10 Î¼g/mL). The protein concentration in each well was determined by Dye Reagent\nConcentrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The Renilla luciferase activity\nwas normalized to protein content in each well and expressed as\nrelative luciferase unit/Î¼g protein (RLU/Î¼g protein). The IC50 was\nderived from nonlinear regression analysis of the RLU/Î¼g proteinâˆ’\nconcentration curve in Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, CA).\nCell Growth Inhibition Assay. The growth inhibition of different\ncell types was assessed by MTT assay using MTT reagent (Sigma, St.\nLouis, MO). Briefly, the cells were plated into 96-well plates and the\ncells were allowed to attach to the bottom of the plates overnight.\nThen the cells were treated with different concentrations of different\ndrugs for 72 h. The media were removed, and MTT reagent in\ncomplete tissue culture media (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well\nand incubated at 37 Â°C for 3 h. The incubation media were removed\nand 100 Î¼L of DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance of the\nformed purple formazan solution was read at 570 nm using Packard\nFusion plate reader. The percent of growth is defined as 100 Ã— (Atreated\nâˆ’ Ainitial)/(Acontrol âˆ’ Ainitial), where Atreated represents absorbance in\nwells treated with a compound, Ainitial represents the absorbance at\ntime 0, and Acontrol denotes media-treated cells.

        bat:hasParagraph  "pressed, and purified as previously described.23\nProtein Stability Shift Assay. Thermal melting experiments were\ncarried out using an Mx3005p real time PCR machine (Stratagene).\nProteins were buffered in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and\nassayed in a 96-well plate at a final concentration of 2 Î¼M in 20 Î¼L\nvolume. Compounds were added at a final concentration of 10 or 100\nÎ¼M. SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes) was added as a fluorescence\nprobe at a dilution of 1 in 1000. Excitation and emission filters for the\nSYPRO-Orange dye were set to 465 and 590 nm, respectively. The\ntemperature was raised with a step of 3 Â°C per minute from 25 to 96\nÂ°C, and fluorescence readings were taken at each interval. The\ntemperature dependence of the fluorescence during the protein\ndenaturation process was approximated by the equation \n...\nwhere Î”uG is the difference in unfolding free energy between the\nfolded and unfolded state, R is the gas constant, and yF and yU are the\nfluorescence intensity of the probe in the presence of completely\nfolded and unfolded protein, respectively.65 The baselines of the\ndenatured and native states were approximated by a linear fit. The\nobserved temperature shifts, Î”Tm\nobs, were recorded as the difference\nbetween the transition midpoints of sample and reference wells\ncontaining protein without ligand in the same plate and determined by\nnonlinear least-squares fit. Temperature shifts (Î”Tm\nobs) for three\nindependent measurements per proteins/compound are summarized\nin Supporting Information Table S1.\n\nIsothermal Titration Calorimetry. Experiments were carried out\non an ITC200 titration microcalorimeter from MicroCal, LLC (GE\nHealthcare) equipped with a Washing module, with a cell volume of\n0.2003 mL, and a 40 Î¼L microsyringe. Experiments were carried out at\n15 Â°C while stirring at 1000 rpm, in ITC buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH\n7.5 (at 25 Â°C), 150 mM NaCl). The microsyringe was loaded with a\nsolution of the protein sample (300âˆ’740 Î¼M protein for BRD9 and\nBRD4(1), respectively, in ITC buffer) and was carefully inserted into\nthe calorimetric cell which was filled with an amount of the ligand (0.2\nmL, 20âˆ’25 Î¼M in ITC buffer). The system was first allowed to\nequilibrate until the cell temperature reached 15 Â°C, and an additional\ndelay of 60 s was applied. All titrations were conducted using an initial\ncontrol injection of 0.3 Î¼L followed by 38 identical injections of 1 Î¼L\nwith a duration of 2 s (per injection) and a spacing of 120 s between\ninjections. The titration experiments were designed in such a fashion\nas to ensure complete saturation of the proteins before the final\ninjection. The heat of dilution for the proteins was independent of\ntheir concentration and corresponded to the heat observed from the\nlast injection, following saturation of ligand binding, thus facilitating\nthe estimation of the baseline of each titration from the last injection.\nThe collected data were corrected for protein heats of dilution\n(measured on separate experiments by titrating the proteins into ITC\nbuffer) and deconvoluted using the MicroCal Origin software supplied\nwith the instrument to yield enthalpies of binding (Î”H) and binding\nconstants (KB) in the same fashion as that previously described in\ndetail by Wiseman and co-workers.66 Thermodynamic parameters\nwere calculated using the basic equation of thermodynamics (Î”G = \nÎ”H âˆ’ TÎ”S = âˆ’RT ln KB, where Î”G, Î”H, and Î”S are the changes in\nfree energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively). In all cases\na single binding site model was employed, supplied with the MicroCal\nOrigin software package. Dissociation constants and thermodynamic\nparameters are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3." ;

Screening compounds were purchased\nfrom Enamine (Enamine Ltd., Riga, Latvia), Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich\n(Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, MO), and AvaChem (AvaChem\nScientific, San Antonio, TX), all with a purity â‰¥95% (see Supporting\nInformation, Table S4). Tiagabine was obtained from Sanofi-\nSynthelabo, Montpellier, France.\nCell lines of HEK293 cells stably expressing YrGAT-1 were\ngenerated as described elsewhere.8 Cloned cells (âˆ¼4 Ã— 104 cells/well)\nwere seeded and grown at 37Â° on poly(D)-lysine coated standard\nplasticware 24 h in advance.\nUptake of [3\nH]-GABA into was measured in the presence of 100\nÎ¼M of the compounds, while unspecific uptake was defined as uptake\nin the presence of 100 Î¼M tiagabine. For IC50 determination tested\nconcentrations were: 5, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10, 100 Î¼M; 27a, 0.01,\n0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 Î¼M. After 3 min preincubation, [3\nH]-GABA\n(35 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) in a final concentration of\n0.015 Î¼M was added. Uptake was stopped by adding ice-cold KrebsHEPES\nbuffer (10 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with 35.9 mM solid\nNaOH, 120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, and 2\nmM D-glucose as supplement). Cells were lysed with 1% SDS (sodium\ndodecyl sulfate) solution, taken up in 2 mL of scintillation cocktail\n(Rotiszint Eco Plus, Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and\ncounted in a standard liquid scintillation counter (Packard TriCarb\n2300TR, Packard Instruments). At least three independent experiments\nper compound were performed, each in triplicate. Data analysis\nwas performed by nonlinear regression using Prism 6.01." ;
