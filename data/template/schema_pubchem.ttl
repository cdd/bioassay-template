        bat:hasParagraph  "The ubiquitin-proteasome system has won the reputation of the cellular recycling center that\ndegraded aggregated or misfolded proteins in the cell (ref. [1] and references therein). Although\nthe ubiquitin system is now known to control many other physiological processes through regulating\nthe turnover and activity of normal cellular proteins, the recycling or disposal function is still\none of the most vital activities of the ubiquitin system. For example, the failure to degrade\nhill-folded or aggregated proteins in neuronal cells has been linked to several neurodegenerative\ndiseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The degradation of unfolded proteins by the\nubiquitin system is coordinated with the other major protein folding control system in the cell,\nthe Hsp chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90. It is believed that exposed hydrophobic regions in\nunfolded proteins are recognized by Hsp proteins via their beta-domains and eventually refolded.\nHowever, if refolding fails, misfolded proteins are thought to be degraded by the proteasome.\nBecause of the multitude of binding events and associated cellular activities of Ubc13, we propose\nto use unbiased NMR-based screens to identify high-affinity ligands to further probe the role of\nthis central ubiquitin conjugating enzyme in protein degradation, DNA repair and IKB alpha I kinase\nactivation.\n\n1. Protein expression and purification \nUbc13 protein expression and purification for NMR studies.  We expressed and purified Ubc13 protein\nto provide the necessary protein reagents for 1D 1H NMR and  2D 15N 1H HSQC NMR studies.  Ubc13 was\npreviously cloned into pETShin-(His)9 vector at BamH1 and Xho1 sites and transformed into BL21/DE3\nE.coli cells.  Proteins in either labeled (15N form for 15N 1H HSQC studies) or unlabeled (for 1D\nNMR studies) forms were expressed as required using either minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl\nor LB media, respectively.  Cells were grown at 37 oC to exponential phase (O.D ~ 0.6) and induced\nwith 0.4 mM IPTG (Bio Vectra).  The general protocol for labeled and unlabeled proteins expressed\nfrom pET vector remained the same.  Briefly, cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer consisting of\n1 mM Tris pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme and a mixture of protease inhibitors in the form of\nComplete Mini-EDTA free tablets (Roche).  Lysates were incubated with Ni+-NTA agarose (Qiagen)\npreviously washed with washing buffer consisting of 1 mM Tris, pH 7.0 and 1 mM DTT.  Proteins were\neluted with imidazole (Sigma) under linear gradient conditions followed by FPLC purification\n(Pharmacia BioTech) on a MonoQ column using gradient conditions (0 to 1 M NaCl).  This protocol\ngenerally yielded proteins of > 90% purity.  SDS-PAGE gel analysis of labeled and unlabeled\nversions of Ubc13 protein purified by FPLC yielded coomasie-stained bands that corresponded to MW\nof ~ 17 kDa.  Gelcode blue stain reagent (Pierce) and DI water were used for staining and\ndestaining, respectively.  Unlabeled UBC13 was supplied in 50 mM HEPES @ 7.5 buffer and labeled\nUBC13 was supplied in 50 mM HEPES @ 7.5 buffer containing 20% D20.  \n2. Compound Library Screened by NMR\nWe have assembled a scaffold library composed of ~ 4,000 compounds. The compounds have been\nselected based on their anticipated use as building blocks or scaffolds components of further\noptimized molecules. The scaffold library has been acquired from three different sources and the\nchemical structures of the library have been deposited into PubChem. In line with the general NIH\nMolecular Libraries Screening Centers Network (MLSCN) library, we have also included a collection\nof 602 Natural Products (MicroSource) that could be screened by NMR\n3. Screening description\nLigand binding was monitored by comparing the aliphatic region of 1D 1H NMR spectra of a 20 uM\nUbc13 solution (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 100% D2O; T= 300 K) in the\npresence and in absence of compounds tested at a final concentration of 100 uM. Compounds were\ninitially tested at mixtures of 20, and then individual compounds for those mixtures that caused\nsignificant perturbations in the spectrum were further deconvoluted.  No significant hits were\nreported by this screen. Only a few natural products were identified as weak binders (500 < Kd <\n1000 uM) and their site of binding verified by 2D [15N, 1H] HSQC. These are Pubchem Substance IDs:\n11537556; 11537407; 11537396; 11537489; 11537422; 11537399; 11537676. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by\ntracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line.\nFreshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000\ncells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight\nincubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD\nBioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1\nsecond/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of\ncompound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically\nat 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg,\ncompounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential\nagonists).  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) or\nEC80 (negative modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head. Measurements are taken\nkinetically for an additional 180 seconds.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dose-response biochemical assay for inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) activity\n\nForty-six compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled \"Primary\nbiochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13)\nactivity\" (PubChem AID = 570) have been assessed in this dose response experiment.\nAs with the primary screen, this assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave a fluorogenic\ntriple-helical peptide (fTHP), which has been modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site\nrecognized by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens.  The fTHP is labeled with both a\n(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl fluorophore (Mca) and a 2,4-dinitrophenyl quencher (Dnp) that\ncomprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the fHTP peptide results in\nliberation of Mca fluorescence.\nIn this assay, the fluorescence signal from unquenched Mca is directly proportional to MMP-13\nactivity. \nThe dose-response assay was conducted in 1536 well plate format. Each compound was assayed in\ntriplicate, using 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 39.8\nmicromolar.\n\nThis assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5\nmicroliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate in Assay Buffer (50\nmillimolar Tris-HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2, pH 7.5) were\ndispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive and negative\ncontrol (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor and DMSO, respectively), were added to the appropriate\nwells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in\nAssay Buffer (same composition as above). After 4 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celcius, 5\nmicroliters of 50 millimolar EDTA was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes at\n25 degrees Celsius and emission fluorescence was read on the Perkin-Elmer Viewlux microplate reader\n(excitation = 325nm, emission = 450nm). \nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\nPercent inhibition = (I450_test_compound -median_I450_negative_control)/(median_I450_positive_control\n- median_I450_negative_control)*100\nWhere:\nI450 represents the fluorescence intensity read at 450nm during an excitation at 325nm;\nPositive_control is test wells that contain 8 micromolar MMP13 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences, San\nDiego, CA)\nNegative_control is test wells that contain DMSO only\nFor each compound, percentage inhibitions were plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% inhibition level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 39.8 micromolar) did not result in greater\nthan 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 39.8 micromolar. Compounds\nwith IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 of equal to\nor less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\nList of reagents:\nMMP13 enzyme (R&D Systems cat# 511-MM-010, Minneapolis, MN)\nMMP13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.B.

Cytotoxicity can be determined for example as a measure of radioisotope (3H thymidine or 51Cr) release, lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells, tetrazolium salt and alamar blue reduction, fluorescent dyes that selectively stain live or dead cells,  or decrease in ATP content. ATP levels are detected using a luminescence based assay kit such as CellTiter-Glo (Promega).

The compound treatment is preferably performed in a short window of time to avoid masking the effect due to cell proliferation.\nCompound cytotoxicity is an important parameter to measure when developing potential human therapeutics. Cytotoxicity is determined as a measure of radioisotope (3H thymidine or 51Cr) release, lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells, tetrazolium salt and alamar blue reduction, fluorescent dyes that selectively stain live or dead cells, and decrease in ATP content. ATP levels are detected using a luminescence based assay kit such as CellTiter-Glo (Promega). ATP values higher than controls indicate proliferation and cultures with ATP concentrations lower than controls indicate cytotoxicity.\n\nPercent cytotoxicity = 100-percent viability" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave fluorogenic triple-helical peptide (fTHP), which\nwas modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens.  The\nfTHP is labeled with both a fluorophore (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (Mca) and quencher\n2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) that comprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the\nfHTP peptide results in liberation of the fluorescent Mca moiety. In this assay, the fluorescence\nsignal from liberated Mca is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity. \nThe primary HTS campaign was conducted in 1536 well plate format. All compounds were tested once at\na 4 micromolar final concentration.\n\nThis assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5\nmicroliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.\nFields, Florida Atlantic University) in assay buffer (50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl,\n0.05% Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of\ntest compound or positive and negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences) and\nDMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by\ndispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in assay buffer (50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100\nmillimolar NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2). After 4 hours of incubation, 5 microliters of\n50 millimolar EDTA was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes and fluorescence\nwas read on Perkin-Elmer Viewlux for 1 second. \n\nPrior to inhibition calculations, basal signal (i.e. signal from wells containing all reagents\nminus inhibitor) was subtracted from test compound and control well values. To calculate percent\ninhibition, the test compound well signal was divided by the median signal from the 100 percent\ninhibition control (i.e. wells containing MMP-13 inhibitor) and multiplied by 100.  A mathematical\nalgorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary screen. Two values\nwere calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all wells in the sample field of control\nplate devoid of test or control compounds, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of\nthese two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater\n%inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. \nThis assay was found to be prone to fluorescent artifacts due to short excitation wavelength of the\nfluorophore (Mca). Compounds that appeared to be fluorescent artifact were labeled as \"possible\nfluorescent artifact\" in the data submitted to PubChem. \nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary\ninhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Mineralization of cartilage and bone occurs by a series of physicochemical and biochemical\nprocesses that together facilitate the deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) in specific areas of the\nextracellular matrix (ECM). Experimental evidence has pointed to the presence of HA crystals along\ncollagen fibrils in the ECM and also within the lumen of chondroblast- and osteoblast-derived\nmatrix vesicles (MVs). Dr.  Milan's  working model is that bone mineralization is first initiated\nwithin the lumen of MVs. In a second step, HA crystals grow beyond the confines of the MVs and\nbecome exposed to the extracellular milieu where they continue to propagate along collagen fibrils.\nRecent data have indicated that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) plays a crucial role\nin restricting the concentration of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PP), a mineralization\ninhibitor, to maintain a P/PPi ratio permissive for normal bone mineralization. Using a variety of\nsingle and double gene knockout experiments it has been found that mice deficient in TNAP function,\ni.e., Akp2-/- mice, display osteomalacia due to an arrest in the propagation of HA crystals outside\nthe MVs caused by an increase in extracellular PPi concentrations. Inside the MVs, however, HA\ncrystals are still present in Akp2-/- mice. It is hypothesize that a newly identified soluble\nphosphatase, PHOSPHO1, with specificity for phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and phosphoserine (PS)\npresent in the MVs, is responsible for increasing the local concentration of Pi inside the MVs to\nchange the P/PPi ratio to favor precipitation of HA seed crystals. \nThis biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate\nphosphate from  phosphoethanolamine and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent.\n\n1) POSPHO1 was obtained from the assay provider's laboratory.\n2) Assay Buffer: 20mM MES-NaOH pH 6.7, 2mM MgCl2, 0.0125% Tween-20, 0.01% BSA\nProcedure\n1) Dispense 1.5ul of assay buffer into columns 1 and 2 of a black, clear bottom Corning (#3891)\n1536 well assay plate.\n2) Dispense 1.5ul of PHOSPHO1 (2.5ng/ml) in assay buffer to wells in columns 3 through 48.\n3) Using a HighRes biosolutions pintool dispense 20nl of 2mM compounds in DMSO to columns 5-48\n4) Dispense 20nl of DMSO to columns 1-4.\n5) Add 1.5ul of assay buffer containing 900uM phosphoethanolamine  to all wells\n6) Incubate lidded plate for 1 hour at room temp. \n7) Add 3ul of Biomol\n8) Incubate for 30 min to allow Biomol signal to develop \n9) Read plate on a Perkin Elmer Viewlux at 630nm in absorbance mode\nEx1:2 = 630 DF10\nEm1:564/250(absorbance); Em2:Clear\nLight energy = 100000\nMeasurement time = 5 sec\n1x binning\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Addiction leading to abuse should  be treatable by pharmacological approaches, and programs that\nidentify new drugs to treat methamphetamine abuse address an immediate goal of the National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) that new approaches are needed for treating METH addiction.\nCurrently, small molecule drug-like compounds are not available for treating METH abuse.\nNeurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) peptide agonists produce behaviors that are exactly opposite to the\npsychostimulant effects observed with methamphetamine abuse, such as hyperactivity, neurotoxicity,\npsychotic episodes, and cognitive deficits, and repeated administrations of NTR1 agonists do not\nlead to the development of tolerance. These data form the basis of the idea that neurotensin\nreceptors are valid targets for antagonizing drug seeking behaviors and preventing relapses.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists: Fluorescence-based cell-based high\nthroughput dose response assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin 1 receptor (V1R).\n\nThe purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a\nset of previous experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput\nscreening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)\" (AID 2435), and inactive in a\nset of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen for Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) agonists:\nFluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput assay to identify agonists of the vasopressin\n1 receptor (V1R)\" (AID 2797), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the Oxytocin\nReceptor (OXTR)\" (AID 434963), are nonselective OXTR agonists due to activation of the related\nGPCR, vasopressin receptor 1 (V1). This assay determines V1R agonism dose response curves for\ncompounds.\nIn this counterscreen assay a stable CHO cell line transfected with V1 is incubated with a\nfluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of\ntest compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds\nthat act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative\nfluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in\ntriplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9\nuM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10%\nv/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well\nmicrotiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of\nthe fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated\nfor 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature.\nThen, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone\nwere dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate\nfluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the\nremaining 94 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. \nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value > 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-94, and for inactive compounds 54-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO-V1R cells (provided by Assay provider)\nVasopressin (Sigma-Aldrich, part V9879)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (AAT Bioquest, part 2456)\nF-12 (Ham) (Invitrogen, part 11765)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 159910)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no published patents or studies specifically describing small molecule\nantagonists of the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand\nfor the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the\nchemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a\nrole at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells,\nand dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a\nrecent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal\nliver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in\nprimary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the\nmetastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation\nof the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases\nincluding hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis.\nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as\n'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important\nobjective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer\nmetastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis. \nIn this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor\nresulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.\nThe goal of this assay is to validate hits obtained in \"uHTS identification of small molecule\nantagonists of the CCR6 receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 493098.\n\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive\nimpairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until\nrecently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1\nselective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which\nprohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1\nPAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all\nallosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse\nchemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS.\nExperimental Protocol:\nCHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for\n45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4\n(1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All\ncompounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 2X stock concentration in 0.6 percent DMSO. This stock\nwas then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent.  Acetylcholine CRC\nserial dilutions were prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay\nplates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices,\nSunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or\nvehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then\nstimulated for 50 sec with a one of eight concentrations of the Acetylcholine CRC.  The signal\namplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to\nacetylcholine. EC50 values for the Acetylcholine CRC alone (i.e. plus Vehicle) and in the presence\nof a fixed concentration of test compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit\ncurves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compounds with a calculated EC50 at\n10uM were assigned as 'Active' and given a score of '100'. All other compounds were assigned as\n'Inactive' and given a score of '0'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions.\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man,\nannually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. \nGlucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite,\nthe bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  \nHexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of\nATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that\nHK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is\nlethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been\nunsuccessful.  Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have\nbeen developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. \nT. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome\n10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical.  TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian\nHKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and\nhuman HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets.  Indeed, it has been suggested that the\npossibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote, \nand now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long\nsought-after inhibitors a possibility. \n \nThus, a simple \"mix and read\" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of\nPittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening\nCenter Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the\nenzyme.  This assay was used to determine confirm the inhibitory activity of the primary hits via\nIC50 determinations.  \nBasic Assay protocol\nThe basic procedure for the TbHK1 assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture components\nas follows: \n1     15 uL of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final compound concentration range =\n0-100 uM). \n2     15 uL of a glucose + ATP + MgCl2 + NAD+ + G6PDH mixture is added with final concentrations of\n0.5mM, 0.35mM, 1.5mM, 3mM, and 0.006mUnits/uL, respectively.\n3     15 uL of TbHK1 enzyme is added per well (final 0.5ng/uL).\n4     Reaction incubates for 2 hours at room temperature. \n5     5 uL EDTA is added (final 50mM). \n6     Data was captured at A340 and represents the increase in NADH  \n      in the reaction mixture. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence counterscreen for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: Cell-based high-throughput\ndose response assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding\nbehavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation.\nImportantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY\nmediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors\n(GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have\nimplicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2),\nanxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling\n(6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and\ntumorigenesis (10). Due to the varied role of these receptors in human disease and physiology, the\nidentification of high affinity selective probes that target each receptor subtype may provide\nnovel tools for the study of NPY-related pathologies.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1304), and \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for\npotentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1546),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID\n1359), and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (AID 1704) were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2.\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will\nincrease Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe\nfluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a\nfinal nominal concentration of 3.6 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed\ninto each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the\nplates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence\nmeasurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM\nfinal concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 micromolar final nominal\nconcentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells.\nThe plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1\nmicroliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration)\nand the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The\nplates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control )/ ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n- MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol.\nAny compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Y2\nPotentiator Primary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been\nnormalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are\nreported as activity score zero.\nThe activity score range for inactive compounds is 100-0.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Assay Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized\nmodel system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also\nclosely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and\nmortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes\ndisease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue.\nUnlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of\nthe population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio\nvaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are\nunclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these\nPolyomaviruses.\nThe oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor\nantigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that\nTAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that\nmutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular\ntransformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate\nthe unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous\nATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions\nhas been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of\nTAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in\ninfected cells.\nChemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the\ncatastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully\ndeveloped a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus\ninhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays\nfor target validation will allow a prioritization of \"hits\" from the primary screen. A biochemical\nfluorescence-intensity assay in 1536-well microplate format was developed to measure TAg ATPase\nactivity in the presence of potentially inhibitory compounds. Z values are ~0.68, with > 3-fold S/B\nand a high (5%) DMSO tolerance. \nThe assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. Assay buffer was 100mM\nTris-HCl, 20mM KCl, 6mM MgCl2, and 0.1mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4. Initially, 250nl of test compound (20uM\nfinal concentration) in 4% DMSO/assay buffer was added to the respective plate wells. Total\nreaction volume (without endpoint reagent) was 1.25ul. Total read volume (with endpoint reagent)\nwas 5 ul. Enzyme and buffer volumeswere dispensed using a BioRAPTR FRD (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,\nCA). Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 500 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA).\nPurified TAg was diluted to a concentration of 0.0144 ug/ul in assay buffer. 750nl of TAg\n(14.4ng/ul, 10.8ng total) in assay buffer was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 30m at\nambient temperature. Following incubation, 250nl of 5mM ATP (A7699, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)\nin assay buffer was added to the respective wells, and incubated for 120m at ambient temperature.\nFinal DMSO concentration was 1.0%. \nEndpoint addition and read: After incubation, the ADPHunter-Plus Kit (DiscoverX, Freemont, CA) was\nused to determine the extent of TAg-induced ATP hydrolysis. 1.25ul of Reagent A, immediately\nfollowed by 2.5ul of Reagent B, was added to the wells, and allowed to incubate for a further 10m\nat ambient temperature. Addition of the kit stop solution had no effect on the assay and\nsubsequently was not used. The plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision\nplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 530/590nm respectively.\nThis counter screening assay was performed to determine whether selected active compounds from the\nprimary screen interfered with screening reagents or detection methods in the absence of TAg. In\nthis case the addition of 50 uM ADP simulated assay signal. Compounds were added in dose response\nformat. The assay interference counter screen was read 10 minutes following the addition of the\nendpoint reagent.\nControls and Drug Addition: Controls included full reaction wells (TAg, DMSO blank, and ATP),\nbackground wells (Assay buffer, DMSO blank, and ATP), and control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO\nand ATP), per plate. Positive control drug (Mal112B) was diluted in 4% DMSO/assay media and added\nto each plate (250nl at 5x concentration), for a final concentration of 100uM. 2.5nl of compounds\nin 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler\n(Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 20uM. DMSO concentration from the compounds\namounted to 0.2%, bringing the total per well to 1%. DMSO in control wells was also supplemented,\nto maintain a concentration of 1% for all wells of each plate.\nLarge T Antigen purification: TAg was purified essentially as described by Cantalupo, P., et.\nal.,1999. Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with a TAg-encoding baculovirus. At 45 hpi, cells were\nharvested and lysed in LiCl and NP40-containing lysis buffer. The lysate was spun at 27000g and the\nhigh speed supernatant was loaded to a Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences)\ncolumn to which the resin had been covalently crosslinked to the monoclonal antibody PAb419\n(Harlow, E. et. al., 1981). PAb419 has been previously described to recognize an N-terminal epitope\nof TAg. The column was washed, and then eluted at high pH. TAg containing fractions were dialyzed\ninto 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1mM DTT, and flash frozen in\nliquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC.\nData Analysis: 96 full reaction wells, 96 background wells, and 64 control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B\nin DMSO and ATP), per plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data\non a per plate basis. The overall Z score for the primary assay was 0.6. \nResults were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and calculated as: 100*((Median Enzyme\nControl-High Dose Ctrl Drug) - (Test well-High Dose Ctrl Drug))/(Median Enzyme Ctrl-High Dose Ctrl\nDrug). Dose response results for each concentration were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base\nsoftware. Compounds showing at least 30% inhibition were considered active and IC50 values were\ncalculated using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum\nand minimum locked at 100 and 0.\n" ;

As designed, a GalR2 antagonist will decrease the\nconcentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and will block the nuclear translocation of NFAT, subsequently\nreducing activity of the BLA reporter gene. Changes in BLA expression are monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA\nsubstrate. Antagonists will reduce or prevent FRET.\n\nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were used in\nthis assay.

To\nthe appropriate wells were then added 21 nL of test compound from the MLSCN compound library in\nDMSO (final nominal concentration of 4 micromolar and final DMSO concentration of 0.4%) or DMSO\nonly (for negative control wells). To the sample field was dispensed 1 microliter of Galanin (1-16)\npeptide in 2% BSA (final concentration of 150 nM, a concentration that resulted in approximately\n80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (basal activity resulting from 1\nmicroliter of 2% BSA) were dispensed to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated at\n37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours.

Fluorescence values measured for each channel\nwere corrected by subtracting \"background\" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells\ncontaining media and substrate only.\nTo normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were\nused to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound: Wells containing test compound\nLow_Control: Wells containing 1 microliter of 2% BSA in PBS\nHigh_Control: Wells containing 1 microliter of 1 micromolar Galanin (1-16) in 2% BSA.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

This\nparticular assay uses the H-4-II-E cell line which is derived from rat hepatoma.\n\nThe Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7\nactivities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of\na peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is\nliberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent\nsignal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present.\nUsing the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the H-4-II-E\ncell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was\nperformed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as\npositive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of\ncaspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only)\nand 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify\nantagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous\nset of experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay\nto identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7)\" (AID 1861). Although GPR7 is\nnaturally coupled to G&#945;i, which decreases cAMP levels upon activation, this assay employs a\nchimeric cell line that forces the receptor to use Gqi3, and therefore the assay readout is calcium\nrelease. In this assay HEK cells stably co-transfected with the human GPR7 receptor and G&#945;qi3\n(hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of\nintracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye.\nAs designed, compounds that act as GPR7 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting\nin decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test\ncompounds were assayed in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200\nmicrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 0.625 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of\n1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23\nhours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1\nmM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well.\nAfter incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO,\nor DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30\nminute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm\nexcitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15\nnL of GPR7 agonist (2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the\nappropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the\nremaining 180 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPW.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the confirmation\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter\ncalculated for the Primary screen was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-23, for inactive 23-0.\nList of Reagents:\nhGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line (provided by Assay Provider)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (ABD Bioquest, part 2456)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nHygromycin-B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Omega scientific, part FB-02)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n1536-well plates (Aurora, part 19326)\nhNPW-23 (Anaspec, part 61653)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted\npyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to\nbe crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas\nSpecialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications\nincluded functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the\n3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to\nthe fully unsaturated pyrazole.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues.  Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders. \nAs one method of confirming the specific activity of compounds active in the primary screen (AID\n1461), we developed an assay to measure the displacement of radio-labeled native ligand, NPS, from\nits receptor in vitro. The lack of displacement does not necessarily indicate that a compound is\nnon-specific for the NPS receptor, rather, it indicates that the binding site is unlikely to be the\nsame as the native ligand.\nThe assay was carried out as described  with minor\nmodification. \nY10-NPS labeled with 125I was bought from NEN Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA).

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a previous set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors\nof Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)\" (AID 1515). In this biochemical assay, recombinant\nFam108b protein is incubated with test compounds and FP-Rh probe. The reaction is excited with\nlinear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value\n(mP). As designed, test compounds that act as Fam 108b inhibitors will prevent Fam 108b-probe\ninteractions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well,\nleading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 9.51 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris\nHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 0.625 micromolar of Fam108b protein were dispensed\ninto 1536 microtiter plates. Catalytically dead Fam108b (S170A) protein (0.625 micromolar) in Assay\nBuffer was dispensed to positive control wells. Next, 48 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone\n(0.0.951% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at\n25 degrees Celsius.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all\nwells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius,\nfluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland)\nusing a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission =\n598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and\nperpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer\nViewlux software.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )\nWhere:\nLow_Control is defined as the median value of wells containing Fam108b.\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing Fam 108b in the presence of test compound.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing catalytically dead Fam 108b (S170A) protein in the\npresence of DMSO.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their\nstandard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter; any compound that\nexhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter calculated for the Primary screen was\ndeclared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-3, for inactive 3-0.\nList of Reagents:\nRecombinant Fam108b (supplied by Assay Provider)\nRecombinant Fam108b (S170A) (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFP-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider)\nTris HCl (Sigma, part T3038)\nNaCl (Sigma, part S6546)\nPluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176)\nDTT (Invitrogen, part 15508-013)\n" ;

S1P, the agonist for the S1P3 receptor was added to positive control wells to a final\nconcentration of 1.0 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100).\nPlates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2 microliter/well\nof the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2\nhours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590\nnm & 460 nm.  The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. \nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%Activation= ((test_compound - median_negative_control)/(median_positive_control -\nmedian_negative_control))*100\nThe negative control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the\npositive controls wells were treated with the EC100 of S1P.\nFor each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition\nor where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\ninhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10\nmicromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar are\nconsidered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This result in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene\nunder control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1\nactivation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism\nwas measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation\nof adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of\nthe CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators\nwould increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely\nproportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1\nagonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate.\nTo discover both S1P1 agonists and agonism potentiators, the primary uHTS campaign was run in\n\"potentiator\" mode, described as follows. All compounds were tested in the presence of the EC20 (2\nnM) of the S1P1-selective agonist SEW2871 and the EC80 (4 micromolar) of forskolin. The EC20 of\nSEW2871 was used in order to identify both S1P1 agonists and agonism potentiators. All data\nreported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained the EC100 of SEW2871 (1\nmicromolar) and the EC80 of forskolin. \n\nThe primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10\nmicromolar final concentration. \n\nFor all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was used, stably transfected with human\nS1P1 receptor (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct.\nCells were cultured in T-175 cm2 Corning flasks (part#431080) at 37 degrees C and 95% RH. The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen# part#11965-092) containing\n10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone part#SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen\npart#1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen part#11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen#\npart#15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen part#25030-081), 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen\npart#10131-027), and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen part#15140-122).\nPrior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red\nfree Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran\ntreated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM\nHEPES, and 5mM L-Glutamine. \n\nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next\nday, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and\nSEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar\n(forskolin's EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871's EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871\nwas also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e.\nits EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1\nmicroliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer#part#K1085),\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma\npart#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm\nand emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting\n\"background\" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm\nfluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of\nthe positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive\ncontrol.\n" ;

RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22),\nt(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22),\nt(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with\nmyeloid and lymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of\na common chromosomal translocation, inv(16).\nThe role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was\nrecently examined.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The concept of biased agonism [1] is an emerging concept of molecular pharmacology which proposes\nthat seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), exist in\nmultiple signaling conformations and complexes and that ligands (either agonists or antagonists)\ncan induce signaling biased responses for distinct signal transduction cascades. \nRecently, this concept has been highlighted by beta-arrestin-biased signaling through 7TMRs [1].\nbeta-arrestins have been known to interact with agonist-occupied 7TMRs and thus to sterically\ninhibit coupling of the receptor to G proteins, leading to termination of signaling. Furthermore,\naccumulating evidence over the last decade has drawn attention to a novel function of\nbeta-arrestins as signal transducers that scaffold various signaling molecules upon activation of\n7TMRs. In particular, beta-arrestins have been shown to mediate activation of several signaling\npathways upon stimulation of 7TM receptors even in the absence of G protein activation [2]. This\nbeta-arrestin-biased signaling presumably leads to distinct physiological outcomes from those by G\nprotein activation. \nAdditionally, the active receptor conformations which prefer on this beta-arrestin signaling are\nlikely different from those activating G protein signaling \nOne of the systems in which biased agonism has been thoroughly elucidated is beta2-adrenergic\nreceptors (beta2-ARs), where the 'antagonist' ligand carvedilol has been demonstrated to\nselectively activate beta-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways [3]. \nThe goal of this screening project will be to discover and optimize novel beta-arrestin-biased\nligands for beta2-AR signaling. A luminescent cell-based assay for beta2-AR-mediated agonism, known\nas the Tango assay [4], has been validated in which ligand binding of a recombinant beta2-AR and\nsubsequent recruitment of a recombinant beta-arrestin lead to the release of the transcriptional\nactivator tTA, which upregulates transcription of a tTA-responsive luciferase gene.  Compounds with\nbeta2-AR agonist activity lead to an increase in luciferase expression, and upon addition of a\nluciferase detection reagent, demonstrate an increase in luminescence.  Compounds were screened as\na concentration-titration series that ranged from 46 microM to 0.6 nM.\n\nTango cells were dispensed into white, solid, tissue-culture-treated 1536-well plates at 1500\ncells/well in DMEM, containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then, 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were\ndelivered to each well using a pin tool.  Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 for 18 hr.\nThen 2.5 uL luminescent substrate mix (in-house prepared: 150 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, 1%\nTriton X-100, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM CoA, 0.15 mM ATP, 0.44 mM D-luciferin, final concentrations) was\nadded to each well.  Plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and\nsubsequently measured on a ViewLux plate reader for luminescent signal using a clear filter with a\n10 second exposure and 2x binning. The %Activity was determined from the corrected luminescence\nvalues. Isoproterenol, a well-characterized beta2-AR full agonist, and metaproterenol, a less\npotent beta2-AR agonist, were included both in 16-pt titration and at full response concentration\nto normalize %Activity of identified agonists; DMSO-pinned controls were used to normalize\n0%Activity (zero agonism), while EC100 isoproterenol and/or EC100 metaproterenol were used to\nnormalize 100%Activity (full agonism). \nConcentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the resulting luminescence.\nThe concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response\nmagnitude and degree of measured activity, and compounds were subsequently categorized based on\ntheir curve class. Active agonists showed concentration-dependent increases in luminescence,\nconcordant with an increase in bound beta2-AR and luciferase expression.  Inactive compounds showed\nno effect on luminescence signal.\n" ;

In this assay a CHO\ncell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium\nindicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor\nlevels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR\nagonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the\nindicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10%\nv/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well\nmicrotiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of\nthe fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated\nfor 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature.\nNext, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone\nwere dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate\nfluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the\nremaining 95 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. \nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value > 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-70, and for inactive compounds 51-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO-OTR cells (provided by Assay provider)\nOxytocin (Sigma-Aldrich, part 06379)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (AAT Bioquest, part 2456)\nF-12 (Ham) (Invitrogen, part 11765)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, part 159910)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\nTo measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units.

The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by\nchallenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration;\nEC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS.\n The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: \nRatio = (T45 / T0)\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))]*100\nWhere: \nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 micromolar.\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active. \nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

The hyperbolic curve of increase in\nfluorescence intensity versus temperature shows the unfolding process. The point of inflexion of\nthis trace provides the measured parameter known as Tm. A difference in Tm between a control\nwithout the compound and an experiment with the compound present is called a TmShift. Positive\nshifts indicate that the protein is more stable in the presence of the compound, indicating that\nthe compound is bound. Since it is not possible to quantitatively compare TmShift values from\ndifferent experiments containing different components, we mark positive shifts of more than 3\ndegrees celcius as having a PubChem assay score of 100, and all other shifts with a score of 0.\nRegulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) proteins contain domains that terminate the signal\nemanating from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). When a GPCR binds a specific ligand, a signal is\ngenerated that is transmitted to the G-proteins that consist of Galpha and Gbeta-gamma subunits. In\nthe inactive state, Galpha and Gbeta-gamma exist as a complex with the Galpha GTPase in the\ninactive GDP bound form. Upon activation, GDP is replaced with GTP which induces Galpha; and\nGbeta-gamma complex disassociation. At this stage both Galpha and Gbeta-gamma proteins are active.\nGalpha does have an intrinsic GTPase activity but this is greatly enhanced by the association with\nan RGS domain. Hence RGS proteins act as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Once GTP hydrolysis has\ntaken place the GDP-Galpha protein can recombine with Gbeta-gamma thus terminating the signal.\nRGS18 is a member of the B/R4 subfamily of RGS proteins. All of these subfamily members have an\nN-terminal amphipathic helix which enhances the localisation of the protein to the membrane surface\nwhere it is ideally placed to interact with the\nG-proteins. Its expression is most abundant in platelets and megakaryocytes and it binds to\nGalpha-i1, Galpha-i2, Galpha-i3, and Galpha-q but not Galpha-z, Galpha-s or Galpha-12. \nAlthough no direct link to any specific disease is yet proven, RGS18\nis believed to play roles in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation, proliferation and\nchemotaxis, in platelet activation, and as an inhibitor for\nchemokine-induced dendritic cell migration, acting primarily via modulation of Gq\nsignaling. \n\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen for antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7):\ncell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the melanin-concentrating\nhormone receptor 1 (MCHR1).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit MCHR1; GPR24, the receptor for MCH,\na cyclic hypothalamic neuropeptide that promotes food intake (14), increases leptin and insulin\nrelease (15), and modulates energy metabolism (16). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for\ncompounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based\nprimary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled\nreceptor 7 (GPR7)\" (AID 1861), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments\nentitled, \"Fluorescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify\nantagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7)\" (AID 1952). This assay employs HEK cells\nstably co-transfected with human MCHR1 and a chimeric G&#945;qi3. Cells are treated with test\ncompounds followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent,\ncell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as human MCHR1 antagonists\nwill decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator\ndye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate at a final\nnominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe hMCHR1 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200\nmicrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 100 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic\nmix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of\n1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23\nhours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1\nmM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well.\nAfter incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO,\nor DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30\nminute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm\nexcitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15\nnL of MCH peptide agonist (0.2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the\nappropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the\nremaining 180 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, MCH peptide.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the counterscreen.\nTwo values were calculated: (1) the average percent response of a DMSO plate, and (2) three times\nthe standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any\ncompound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. %\nInhibition values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100.

Cleavage of the\nfHTP peptide results in unquenching of the Mca fluorescence. In this assay, the fluorescence signal\nfrom liberated Mca fluorescence is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity.\n\nThis assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5\nmicroliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.B.\nFields, Florida Atlantic University) in Assay Buffer containing 50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100\nmillimolar NaCl, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2, pH 7.5 (all chemicals purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test\ncompound or positive or negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor and DMSO, respectively)\nwere then added to the appropriate wells.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.\nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.  Generally,\nRas proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are\ngeranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these\nprenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. \nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nIn the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary\nscreen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and\ndetermine potency.   \nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and\n0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.\nTest compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially\ndiluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final\ncompound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to\n100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM.\nBeads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response\nexperiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras\nconstitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt,\nRac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound\nworklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce\nannotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an\nExcel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and\nthe fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter\n(SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity\n(MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated.\nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine\ndifferent concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data\npoints. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand\nconcentrations, generating competition curves. \nLigand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA)\nusing nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope,\nalso known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the\nfollowing parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor\nthat inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the\nresponse value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE -\nthe slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE -\nstandard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low\nand high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation\ncoefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit.\nIn order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\n- [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be\nstatistically significant)\n- |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of\nLOGEC50)\n- |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test\ncompound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the\ncompound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 -\n||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|)\nIn this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive\ncompounds the activity score is 0.\n" ;

This assay uses Tango S1P5-BLA U2OS cells which contain\nthe human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 8 (EDG8; S1P5) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription\nfactor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein\nand a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation\nof the S1P5 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through\nproteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor.

BLA expression is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA\nsubstrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P5 agonists will stimulate migration of the\nfusion protein, thus increasing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to an\nincrease in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series\nstarting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth\nmedia consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM\nNEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200\nug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, and 100 ug/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 275,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL\nof cell suspension to each well of a 384 well plate (10000 cells/well), followed by overnight\nincubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final\nDMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (1.5 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2%\nBSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours.\nAfter the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours\nof incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nSelected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to\nnormalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels (ie,\nfluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay\ndata, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm / I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported\nEC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50%\nactivation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50\nuM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than\n50 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100, and for inactive compounds 0-0.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG8-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1518)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a tyrosine kinase involved in growth factor and integrin\nmediated signal transduction pathways\nAs with the primary and confirmation screens, a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance\nenergy transfer (TR-FRET) method to monitor the phosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT)\nsubstrate by FAK was used to screen for inhibitors. The principle of the assay is similar to other\nkinase detection systems utilizing TR-FRET, except this method utilizes a FRET acceptor dye which\nis coupled directly to the substrate. The level of substrate phosphorylation by FAK activity is\ndetected with a specific europium-labeled anti-phospho-peptide antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as\nthe FRET donor. Upon phosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to phosphorylated\ntyrosines of the substrate bring the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, allowing FRET to\noccur. A potential inhibitor of FAK would prevent the proper phosphorylation of the substrate,\ndecreasing the FRET signal.\n\nAssay preparation was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters per well of a solution containing 2 nM\nFAK enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH\n7.0) into a black 1536-well solid bottom non-treated microtiter plate. Next, 35 nL of test compound\nfrom the MLSCN library (final nominal concentration of 7 micromolar, 0.7% final DMSO concentration)\nor positive and negative control (143 micromolar staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then\nadded to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 200 nM\nULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 10 micromolar ATP in kinase buffer. After 60 minutes of\nincubation at room temperature, 5 microliters of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM\nEDTA and 4 nM Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30\nminutes at room temperature.  After excitation at 340 nm, fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu)\nand 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer).   \nTo normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to\ncalculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: \nRatio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 \nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of\nthree replicate wells, calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl -\nMedian_Ratio_HighControl)))*100\nWhere: \nTestCompound = Wells containing test compound\nLowControl = Wells containing DMSO\nHighControl = Wells containing 1 micromolar staurosporine (corresponding to staurosporine#s IC100).\nFor each compound percent inhibition was plotted against test compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 70 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually. Compounds with IC50 of\ngreater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 equal to or less than 10\nmicromolar were considered active. \nThe activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\nList of reagents:  \nATP (Sigma-Aldrich cat# A6559, St. Louis, MO)\nHEPES solution (Invitrogen cat# 15630-114, Carlsbad, CA) \nMgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich cat# M4880-100g, St. Louis, MO)\nEGTA (Sigma-Aldrich cat# E8145, St. Louis, MO)\nTween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich cat# p7949, St. Louis, MO)\nULight poly GT (4:1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences cat# TRF0100, Waltham, MA) \nFAK activated enzyme (Biomol cat# SE448, Plymouth Meeting, PA)\nEu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab (PerkinElmer Life Sciences cat# AD0067)\n10X LANCE Detection buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences cat# CR97-100)\n" ;

There are growing concerns about\nthe cognitive effects of known general anesthetics [1] and acceleration of the onset of\nneurodegenerative disease [2]. The compounds' toxicity [3] and multiple specific binding targets in\nthe mammalian brain [4] has made them less attractive as drug leads. In this assay, a GABAergic\nmimetic model system, apoferritin and a profluorescent 1-aminoanthracene ligand (1-AMA), was used\nto construct a competitive binding assay for identification of novel general anesthetics. The assay\nwas validated for 1-AMA using other known anesthetics, such as isoflurane (CID:3763) and propofol\n\nThree uL of reagents (free 1-AMA (50% saturated solution of 1-aminoanthracene \nin PBS) in columns 3, 4 as negative control and 1-AMA/apoferritin mixture (10 uM horse-spleen\napoferritin in 50% saturated 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 1, 2, 5-48) was dispensed into\n1536-well Greiner black assay plates.

A cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated\nchannel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test\ncompound of the Y2 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate\ncyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and\nas a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential,\nwhich is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2\npotentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG\nchannel opening and therefore reduced probe fluorescence.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed\ninto each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates.

The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the\nplates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the cells were\nchallenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model\nsystem to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely\nrelated to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality\nin immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in\nhumans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV\nand JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the\npopulation examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio\nvaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are\nunclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these\nPolyomaviruses.\nThe oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor\nantigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that\nTAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that\nmutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular\ntransformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate\nthe unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous\nATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions\nhas been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of\nTAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in\ninfected cells.\nChemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the\ncatastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully\ndeveloped a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus\ninhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays\nfor target validation will allow a prioritization of \"hits\" from the primary screen. \nThis assay was conducted with analogs of compounds designated as active in the confirmation and\ncounter screens.  These compounds were evaluated based on % ATPase activity. Those showing <=40%\nATPase activity were deemed sufficiently active for continuation to the secondary screen in BSC1\n(ATCC CCL-26) cells.  Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final\nconcentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown, and plated in 96-well\nmicroplates in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS.  Compounds were added to the cells, followed by\n100 TCID50 units of SV40 virus, and the plates were incubated for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2.\nMAL211B was used as a positive control.  Additional wells were included to evaluate the effects of\nthe same concentrations of compounds in the absence of virus.  At the end of the incubation time\ncells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered\ncytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal in the no virus wells.  Increased cell\nviability in the virus wells indicates effective compounds.  Compounds that interfere with\nluciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.  Compounds that show less than 50% toxicity at\nconcentration twice or greater than that of the TAg-IC50 will be considered as active.\nData Analysis: 8 cell control wells (- virus) and 8 infected wells (cells + virus) per plate were\nused to calculate drug efficacy value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate\nbasis. Efficacy was performed in triplicate on each plate, and cytoxicity was performed in\nduplicate.  Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) of\ncell viability and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - virus control)/(cell control - virus\ncontrol).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Mineralization of cartilage and bone occurs by a series of physicochemical and biochemical\nprocesses that together facilitate the deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) in specific areas of the\nextracellular matrix (ECM). Experimental evidence has pointed to the presence of HA crystals along\ncollagen fibrils in the ECM and also within the lumen of chondroblast- and osteoblast-derived\nmatrix vesicles (MVs). Dr.  Milan's  working model is that bone mineralization is first initiated\nwithin the lumen of MVs. In a second step, HA crystals grow beyond the confines of the MVs and\nbecome exposed to the extracellular milieu where they continue to propagate along collagen fibrils.\nRecent data have indicated that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) plays a crucial role\nin restricting the concentration of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PP), a mineralization\ninhibitor, to maintain a P/PPi ratio permissive for normal bone mineralization. Using a variety of\nsingle and double gene knockout experiments it has been found that mice deficient in TNAP function,\ni.e., Akp2-/- mice, display osteomalacia due to an arrest in the propagation of HA crystals outside\nthe MVs caused by an increase in extracellular PPi concentrations. Inside the MVs, however, HA\ncrystals are still present in Akp2-/- mice. It is hypothesize that a newly identified soluble\nphosphatase, PHOSPHO1, with specificity for phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and phosphoserine (PS)\npresent in the MVs, is responsible for increasing the local concentration of Pi inside the MVs to\nchange the P/PPi ratio to favor precipitation of HA seed crystals. \nThis biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate\nphosphate from  phosphoethanolamine and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nabsorbance assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit PHOSPHO1\" (AID 1565) and to study\nthe structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Project Overview:\nIn most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic\ntranscription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied\nRNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific\nregulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard\ngenetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality. This\nscreen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins\nrequired for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First,\ninhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding\nproteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function\nacross nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent\nthat specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.\n \nThe two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class\ntandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the\ngermline from the soma. MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates\nposterior patterning and germline specification. Both proteins can be expressed and purified from\nEscherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to\nspecific RNA sequences in vitro. Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively\nmonitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate\nreader.\n \nExpected Outcome: The ability of purified MEX-5 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently\nlabeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to\nscreen for inhibitors of this interaction.  Compounds inhibiting the interaction with show a\ndose-dependent reduction in the polarization value (in mP.)\n\n7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844)\nin duplicate assay plates.  Predispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to\ntwo weeks.  For higher concentrations in dose retests, 15 or 30 nL was predispensed.\nMEX-5 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was\nprepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master\nmix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004%\nIPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser\n(Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.  \nThe target binding sequence TCR2 is a Temporal Control Region in the 3' untranslated region of the\nC. elegans gene glp-1 (abnormal Germ Line Proliferation).  Fluorescent TCR2 RNA\n(5'-UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAA-FITC-3', Dharmacon / Thermo) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer\nand supplemented with 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma).  The RNA mastermix was heated at 65 degrees\nfor 2 minutes then cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr, Beckman Coulter) at\nroom temperature.  The dispenser bottle was wrapped in foil to protect from light.\nCompeting unlabeled TCR2 RNA (Dharmacon / Thermo) was prepared as a positive control solution at 25\nuM in 1x buffer.  The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to\nloading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature.\n1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr).\nThe assay plates with predispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on\nthe Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nThe plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either\n1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well\nof competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells).\nThe final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were:\n20 mM tris pH 8.0\n40 mM NaCl\n0.004% IPEGAL\n100 uM zinc acetate\n120 nM MEX5 protein\n2 nM FITC labeled TCR2 RNA\n4 ug/mL tRNA type X\n10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO\nFor positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled TCR2 RNA\nPlates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute.\nOne hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a\nViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer) with a G factor of 1.

For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling.

The fusion\nprotein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that\npromote the association of SRC1 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities,\nallowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as\nan agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution\nseries starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100 mM\nSodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns\nwere filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 ug/mL\nanti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC1 protein [aa\n601-762].\nNext, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL\nof GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO alone (0.8% final\nconcentration) into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees\nCelsius and fluorescence was measured. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored\nat 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical\nexpression:\nRatio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl))\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds\nwith an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 49 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 49 to 100. \nList of Reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part 71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC-1 protein [aa 601-762] (produced by Dr. Scott Busby, Scripps Florida).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous\nsystem resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose\ncontribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated.\nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human delta opioid receptor\n(DOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified\nin \"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nThis image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the\narrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to\ncoated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the\nGFP-arrestins.\nAssay Materials:\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1\nreceptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics\n- 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in\nwater to 1 uM.  \n5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water\n6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO\n7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10\nmM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAssay Procedure:\n1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of\ncompounds. \n4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The \"dose response protocol\" was used\nto dispense corresponding volumes of each 10 mM compound on the assay plate.\na. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62 nM to 32 uM (ten\ndoses), in duplicate.\nb. Positive control was added to column 1.  SNC80 final concentration was 100 nM.\nc. Negative control was added to column 2. DMSO final concentration was 0.31%.\nd. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration.\n5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  \n6) Media was aspirated leaving 20 ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  \n7) 40 ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser\n(Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA.\n8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature.\n9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50 ul PBS leaving 20 ul liquid in each\nwell using a Titertek plate washer.\n10) 40 ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI\nconcentration of 100 ng/ml.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The fusion-active conformation of the envelope protein gp41 of HIV-1 consists of an N-terminal\ntrimeric alpha-helical coiled coil domain, and three anti-parallel C-terminal helices which fold\ndown the grooves of the coiled coil to form a six-helix bundle. Disruption of the six-helix bundle\nis considered to be a key component of an effective non-peptide fusion inhibitor. This structure\nforms as a result of a conformational change in gp41, triggered by gp120 and co-receptor binding to\nhost cell receptors. Prevention of six-helix bundle formation has been recognized as an important\nmechanism for viral fusion inhibition\nA metallopeptide-based fluorescence assay has been developed to detect HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, by\nthe screening of small molecules that bind to the hydrophobic pocket of gp41. The assay involves\ntwo peptides representing the inner N-terminal-heptad-repeat (HR1) coiled coil and the outer\nC-terminal-heptad-repeat (HR2) helical domains of the gp41 six-helix bundle which forms prior to\nfusion. The HR1 peptide is modified with a metal-ligated dye complex, which maintains structural\nintegrity and permits association with a fluorescein-labeled HR2 peptide concomitant with\nfluorescence quenching. Compounds able to disrupt six-helix bundle formation can act as fusion\ninhibitors, and can be detected in the assay from an increase in the fluorescence that is\ncorrelated with compound's efficacy.\nPrimary, single concentration screen:\nAssay materials:\n1) Env2.0 peptide \nSeq: Ac-MTWBEWDREIBNYTSLIC(FAM)-NH2\n2) C18-Aib(FL) peptide \nSeq: bpy-GQAVEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVEKK-NH2\n3) Assay Buffer: 25 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.0, 0.01% Tween-20\n4) The Fe(II) complex [Fe(II)(env2.0)3]2+ is prepared by addition of a one-third stoichiometry of\nfreshly prepared ferrous ammonium sulfate to peptide in 25 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.0\nProcedure\nMix equal parts of the Env2.0/Fe complex and C18-Aib(FL) (60 uM) just prior to the assay\n1) Dispense 4 ul of 60 uM C18-Aib(FL) into columns 1 and 2 of a black, Corning (#2725) 1536 well\nassay plate.\n2) Add 4 ul of 60 uM C18-Aib(FL)/4 uM Env2.0/Fe complex into columns 3-48\n3) Using a HighRes biosolutions pintool dispense 40 nl of 2 mM compounds in DMSO to columns 5-48\n4) Using a HighRes biosolutions pintool dispense 40 nl of DMSO to columns 1-4.\n5) Incubate lidded plate for 30 minutes at room temp. \n6) Read plate on a BMG PHERAstar at 485/520nm in Fluorescence Intensity mode\nPositioning delay = 0.0\nFlashes/well = 10\nDose Response:\nAssay materials:\n5) Env2.0 peptide \nSeq: Ac-MTWBEWDREIBNYTSLIC(FAM)-NH2\n6) C18-Aib(FL) peptide \nSeq: bpy-GQAVEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARILAVEKK-NH2\n7) Assay Buffer: 25 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.0, 0.01% Tween-20\n8) The Fe(II) complex [Fe(II)(env2.0)3]2+ is prepared by addition of a one-third stoichiometry of\nfreshly prepared ferrous ammonium sulfate to peptide in 25 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.0\nProcedure\n1) Using a Labcyte Echo, DMSO and test compounds are transferred to wells of a black, Corning 1536\nwell assay plate.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Yersinia pestis is the causal agent of the bubonic plague and, although modern antibiotics are\nextremely effective against the malady, the plague remains a threat in many areas in the world.\nOutbreaks of hundreds of cases still occur in Asia, Africa and South America and, in the United\nStates cases are reported sporadically, mainly because of people handling infected animals or by\nbeing bitten by infected wild rodent fleas. YopH (Yersinia outer protein H) is\na protein essential for the virulence of Yersinia. YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that\nantagonizes several signaling pathways including those associated with the phagocytosis of bacteria\nby host cells. Upon infection, YopH is translocated into the target cell,\nwhere it localizes to focal complexes. Several proteins have been identified as substrates for YopH\nincluding Cas, paxillin, SKAP-HOM, Fyb and Pyk. Because the phosphatase\nactivity of the Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase, YopH, is essential for virulence in the\nYersinia pathogen, potent and selective YopH inhibitors would be vital to understanding YopH\nsignaling pathways (leading to virulence). The focus of the study presented here was to develop a\nnovel high throughput screening assay that would allow for the identification of small molecules\nthat interfere with YopH functionality.\n\nYopH Phosphatase Activity Protocol for 384-well HTS\nSolutions\n3X Assay buffer\n30 mM Magnesium Chloride\n150 mM HEPES\n3 mM Dithiothreitol\n0.3% BSA\n(pH ~7.0)\n(3X) MAX control\n3% DMSO in water\n(3X) MIN control\n600 mM sodium hydroxide in water\n(3X) IC50 control\n75 mM sodium hydroxide in water\n(3X) Substrate\n75 uM OMFP in water\n(3X) Stop Solution\n600 mM sodium hydroxide in water\n(3X) Test compounds\n150 uM compounds diluted in water (starting concentration for two-fold serial dilution)\n(3X) YopH enzyme\n200 ng/mL in 3X assay buffer\nAssay procedure\n1.Prepare the following reagents in the appropriate diluent.\n2.Transfer 5 uL of the diluted compounds (30 uM) and plate controls to wells of a Greiner 384-well,\nlow-volume, assay plate.\n3.Add 5 uL enzyme (200 ng/mL) and 5 uL substrate (75 uM) using a Flexdrop bulk dispenser.\n4.Centrifuge plates at 500 g X 1 minute.\n5.Incubate plates for 1 hour at room temperature.\n6.Stop the assay reaction by adding 5 uL of stop solution to each well.\n7.Read the fluorescence intensity at EX485/EM525.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors has been found\nprimarily in most immune system cells and some other non-immune cells. NFAT plays the\nimmunomodulatory role, primarily in T-cell activation and differentiation. NFAT target genes are\nalso involved in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation in non-immune cell types. The NFAT\nsequence was engineered to the upstream of the ?-lactamase reporter gene and transfected into\nJurkat cells with co-transfection of muscarinic receptor1 [provided by Invitrogen Corp]. When an\nextracellular stimulus, such as carbachol, binds to the GPCR M1 receptor, it stimulates a signaling\ncascade that activates NFAT response element and ?-lactamase expression by phosphorylating the NFAT\nbinding protein. This cell based ?-lactamase reporter gene assay can accurately monitor any changes\noccurring along the NFAT pathway, and can be used for screening small molecule inhibitor or\nactivator upon activation by carbachol EC50 concentration. A small molecular library were screened\nin a titration series resulting in AC50s (can be either IC50s or EC50s).\n\nThe cells were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% dialyzed FBS and 25 mM HEPES at 1.6 x\n106cell/ml. The assay was performed in 1536-well plate format as follows: 5 ul of cell preparation \n23 nl of compounds 1ul of carbachol (final concentration 1 uM) Briefly centrifuge the plates and\nincubate at 37#C for 5 hours 1 ul of CCF4 dye mixture Incubate the plates at RT for 1 hour  Read\nthe plate in EnVision plate reader (Ex= 405nm, and Em1=460nm and Em2=530nm).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by\nproject collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that\nare labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30\nnanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom\nexcitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a\nsingle bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0\nsupplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing.\nThe 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below)\nare centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50\nmilliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then\nresuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated\nwork station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10\nminutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10\nmilliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds\nRGS proteins with high affinity.\nThis design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is\nassociated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead\nsets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635\nnanom. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7\nmight be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead\nsets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into\n384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead\ncontrol (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a\nfluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the\ntest compounds.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters\n(5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test\ncompound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is\n10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test\ncompound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are\nincubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for\neach well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of\n218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds.\nRGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of\nthe measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative\ncontrol bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that\nparticular protein is \"inconclusive\", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive\n(see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS\nProtein is \"inconclusive\", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant\namounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702\ncompounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. \nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound\n(|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or\ninhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the\ntarget RGS-Galphao interaction. \nRV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and\nRGS7, compounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8,\ncompounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library\ndependent \"edge effect\" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the\ndata set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered \"Active\". Data from compounds\nlocated in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than\n0 or greater than 135 were considered \"Active\". Active compounds include both activators - where\n%Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the\n218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as\npotential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per\nprotein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are\nRGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific.\nRGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel,\nwhich can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has\nthe lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest\nbead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead\nset, the compound is flagged as \"Potential Red Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as\npotential red fluorescent compounds.\nThe Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library,\naverage Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when\nexcluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard\ndeviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for\ntarget RGS16, due to the library dependent \"edge effect\", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68\nstandard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity\nof the protein.\nFor easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the\nsame compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an\nactivator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column\nRi_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where \"i\" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron protein\nSMN. The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2\nwhich are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips\nexon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2\nprotein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1\nlocus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form,\nit is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy\nthat either increases the amount of SMN2 product made increases the inclusion of exon 7 has been\nproposed for the treatment of SMA.\nWe have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional\nSMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that\ninclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus\ngenerating functional luciferase enzyme.\nOne potential source of false positives in the primary screening assay is stabilization of the\nreporter luciferase via direct binding. This assay attempts to identify such compounds by screening\ndirectly for luciferase activity in the absence of the cellular system.\n\nThe primary screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter and splicing\nbased cassettes in tandem with the major portion of the native SMN1 cDNA, and then transfected into\nHEK293 cells. Compounds that modulate luciferase signal presumably modulate expression of native\nSMN1 expression. In this assay, we utilize purified firefly luciferase in lieu of a cellular\nreporter to identify compounds interacting directly with luciferase in the primary screen.\nSequence, Parameter, Value, Description \n(1) Reagent, 2.5 uL, Enzyme in buffer (note A)\n(2) Compound, 23 nL, From stock solutions\n(3) Time, 5 minutes, Room temp\n(4) Reagent#2.5 ul, Luciferase detection reagent  (note B)\n(5) Detector, 1 sec integrate, Luminescent read on Viewlux (note C)\nSigma enzyme (1 mg) considered to be MW 61,000 diluted in 357 ul assay buffer to 50 uM stock.\nA - Enzyme and buffer consists of 50 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.6, 10 mM Mg acetate 0.05% BSA, 0.01%\nTween and 5 nM firefly luciferase\nB - Detection reagent = britelite plus diluted 1:10 in PBS\nC - Viewlux settings were 1 second integration medium sensitivity\n" ;

The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette)\nand  incubated for 24 hours at 37'C in the Liconic CO2 incubator 9 (Model STX 220IC)(General\nautomation system (GS)) (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity.\nDay 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate):\n3.  The MLPCN test compounds plates are transferred from the Compound Management incubators\nSTX1000#1 and #2 system (Liconic Instruments) on the GS to the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 (Model STX\n220HR) before the initiation of the pinning run.

Although the mechanism for lithium action in treatment of bipolar disorder is\nstill not fully understood, inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and the subsequent\ndepletion of the inositol pool in living cells have been implicated as the primary therapeutic\nbenefit of lithium therapy. Therefore, a selective IMPase inhibitor with reduced side effects might\nbe a good drug candidate to replace lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Several IMPase\ninhibitors have been discovered previously. However, they are not suitable for therapeutic use\nbecause of their poor cell membrane penetrability or oral bioavailability; the development of new\ncell-permeable IMPase inhibitors is needed.\nIMPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) to release free inositol. Binding of\nan agonist to a Gq coupled GPCR results in the activation of PLC, which hydrolyzes the PIP2 to form\ninositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). While DAG activates protein kinase C\n(PKC), IP3 triggers the elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. The IP3 is very rapidly inactivated\nby hydrolysis to IP2, IP1 and then inositol by a series of enzymes including IMPase. Free inositols\nare used for synthesis of PI and thus start another inositol cycle.\nTo identify new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors, we developed a cell-based IMPase assay in which\nthe cytosolic IP1 is measured by a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)\nassay. In this assay, an IP1 specific antibody is used to detect the labeled IP1 tracer. When the\ncell lysate contains the elevated IP1 due to the inhibition of IMPase, the TR-FRET between the\nlabeled antibody and IP1 tracer is disrupted resulting in a reduction in the total signal. Since\nthe TR-FRET is used, this cell-based assay is a homogenous assay without cell wash and medium\nchange that is suitable for assay miniaturization and HTS.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the M1 receptor (CHO-M1) was obtained\nfrom ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with\n10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in\na humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The\nassay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission\nwavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the\ncontrols for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (18.4 mM LiCl). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\nIMPase 1536-well assay protocol:\n(1) Plate 4 ul/well (2000 cells) of cell suspension from frozen CHO-M1 Cells in white, tissue\nculture treated 1536-well plates that are cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours.\n(2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Signal transduction pathways mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major therapeutic\ntargets with many known pharmacologic modulators. The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS\nproteins) are a key family of modulators and scaffolds for GPCRs which have been identified by many\nauthors as appealing drug targets [1-5]. RGS proteins bind to activated G proteins and strongly\ninhibit their signals by catalyzing the hydrolysis of bound GTP [6-7]. Consistent with this mode of\naction, genetic deletion of RGS greatly enhances receptor signaling [8-10]. Furthermore, RGS\nproteins display isoform-specific tissue distribution [11-14] and their expression is altered in\npathophysiological states including Parkinson's disease [15], neuropathic pain [16-17],\nschizophrenia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure [18]. An activator of RGS action would be\nexpected to suppress the function of GPCR agonists such as vasoactivators, inflammatory mediators,\nendogenous neurotransmitters, or catecholamines such as L-DOPA. It has recently been established\nthat loss of function of RGS2 causes hypertensive symptoms in mice [19] and may contribute to\nvasoactive disorders in humans as well [20-22]. Also, reduced expression of RGS4 has been\ncorrelated with schizophrenia [23-24]. Consequently, compounds that could either enhance the\nfunction of RGS proteins or could increase their expression might be of therapeutic benefit. The\nidentification of selective modulators of RGS proteins would also greatly facilitate experimental\nstudies of this sizeable protein family (with 20-30 members) by permitting rapid and specific\nchemical potentiation. Such RGS modulators would be particularly useful to determine which RGS\nproteins modulate particular receptor signaling pathways.\nThe goal of this project is to identify potentiators /activators of the regulator of G protein\nsignaling 4 (RGS4), using a receptor-stimulated cell-based Ca++ assay.\n\nTo screen for compounds that activate the RGS4 protein, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses\nM3R and inducibly expresses RGS4 is employed. RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a\ncommercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that do not show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence\nin induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered as activator/potentiator hits. M3 receptor and other\nendogenous receptor activators/potentiators will be excluded through later counter-screening\nagainst non-induced parental cells.\nProtocol for RGS4 Primary Screen:\n1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose,\nw/ glutamine), 10%FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15ug/ml Blasticidin, 400ug/ml G418, 200ug/ml Hygromycin.\n2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with\n10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep. Include 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression.\n3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2.\n4. Remove medium and add 20 ul /well of 2uM Fluo4-AM solution to cells.\n5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37C in incubator.\n6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared\nusing assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4).\n7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 ul/well of assay buffer to cells.\n8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT).\n9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT.\n9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader\n10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline\n11.  After 100 seconds, add 4 ul of ECmax (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence\nfor 100 seconds.\n12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout.\n13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate,\nas well as Z and Z' factors [26]\n14. Calculate B scores [27] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12\n15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is less than 4 times the standard\ndeviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds above the mean (B\nscore Activator Ratio<mean-4*SD), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times\nthe standard deviation plus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is\ndesignated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an activator of RGS4.  Otherwise, it is designated\nas inactive (value=1). \n16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation\nof Int(((Log(ABS(B score ratio))-0.82)/0.44)*100), and they are normalized to the smallest and\nlargest LOG(B score ratio), B score ratio, as in the result definition.  The inactive test\ncompounds are assigned a score of 0.\nList of reagents\n1. HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4 cell lines (provided by assay provider)\n2. PBS: pH7.4 (Invitrogen Cat#10010049)\n3.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model\nsystem to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely\nrelated to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality\nin immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in\nhumans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV\nand JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the\npopulation examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio\nvaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are\nunclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these\nPolyomaviruses.\nThe oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor\nantigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that\nTAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that\nmutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular\ntransformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate\nthe unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous\nATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions\nhas been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of\nTAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in\ninfected cells.\nChemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the\ncatastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully\ndeveloped a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus\ninhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays\nfor target validation will allow a prioritization of \"hits\" from the primary screen.\nThis assay was conducted with compounds and analogs designated as active in the confirmation and\ncounter screens.  These compounds were first evaluated using the primary biochemical assay based on\n% ATPase activity. Those showing <=40% ATPase activity were deemed sufficiently active for\ncontinuation to this secondary screen in BSC1 (ATCC CCL-26) cells.  \nCompounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed\nby the addition of cells.  Cells were grown, and plated in 96-well microplates in\nDMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS.  Compounds were added to the cells, followed by 100 TCID50\nunits of SV40 virus, and the plates were incubated for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. MAL211B was\nused as a positive control.  Additional wells were included to evaluate the effects of the same\nconcentrations of compounds in the absence of virus.  At the end of the incubation time cells were\nassayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic\nresulted in a decreased luminescent signal in the no virus wells.  Increased cell viability in the\ncompound + virus wells indicates effective compounds.  Compounds that interfere with luciferase\nwill appear as toxic in this screen.  Compounds that show less than 50% toxicity at concentration\ntwice or greater than that of the  cell viability efficacy IC50 will be considered as active.\nData Analysis: 8 cell control wells (- virus) and 8 infected wells (cells + virus) per plate were\nused to calculate drug efficacy value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate\nbasis. Efficacy was performed in triplicate on each plate, and cytoxicity was performed in\nduplicate.  Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) of\ncell viability and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - virus control)/(cell control - virus\ncontrol). From these curves IC50 values were calculated.     \n" ;

Well fluorescence was read\nafter 1 hour of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer).\nPrior to inhibition calculations the ratio between RFU values obtained at t0 (RFU_t0) and t60\n(RFU_t60), named Ratio_RFU, was calculated as follows:\nRatio_RFU = RFU_t60/RFU_t0\nThe percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:\nPercent inhibition = (test_compound_ Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)/(positive_control_\nRatio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing Thioflavine S.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 32 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 32 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nNS3 helicase fragment (supplied by Assay Provider)\nCy5/quencher-labeled molecular beacon (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc, custom synthesized)\nThioflavine S (Sigma-Aldrich, part T1892)\nMOPS (Fisher-Biotech, part BP308-100)\nATP (Fisher-BioReagents, part BP413-25)\nMagnesium Chloride (Fisher-Biotech, part BP214-500)\nAssay Buffer (supplied by Assay Provider)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789173)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that\ninhibit KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) potassium channels.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit KCNQ2 potassium channels. This\nassay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are\ntreated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a\nthallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were\nmeasured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit.  Those CHO-K1 cells\nstably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells\nwere loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed\nby the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and\ndetected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence\nof FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was\nevaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the\ncompound has a B-score of less than minus 3*SD of the average B score of the library compounds, the\ncompound is then considered to be active as a inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channel.\nProtocol for the KCNQ2 project:\n1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal\nBovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418.\n2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS.\n3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2.\n4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells. \n5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in darkness.\n6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on the Cybi-Well system: test compounds are\nprepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (IC0), ICmax of XE-991  (all with DMSO\nconcentrations matched to that of test compounds).\n7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells.\n8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system.\n9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in darkness.\n10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4.\n11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.\n12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline.\n13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110\nseconds.\n14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0.\n15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate,\nas well as Z and Z' factors [13].\n16. Calculate B scores [14] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14.\n17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more negative than -3 times the\nstandard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (<=-3*SD), AND the B\nscore of initial fluorescence intensity is within 2 times the standard deviation of the B scores of\nthe library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as an active (Value=2) inhibitor\nof the KCNQ2 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). \n18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation\nof INT(100*LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio)), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B\nScore inhibitor Ratio), B Score inhibitor Ratio, as in the result definition.\nList of reagents\n1.

Electrically active cells, such as neurons, muscle and endocrine cells undergo changes in membrane potential due to depolarization and hyperpolarization as a result of opening and closing of ion channels. Action potentials are large and rapid changes in membrane potential which are generated as a result of a large depolarization event. In neurons, action potentials are used to transmit signals across neurons, while in muscle and endocrine cells, they lead to intracellular events, such as muscle contraction and hormone release, respectively.\nIn addition, mitochondria possess a trans-membrane potential as a result of their respiratory function.\nMembrane potential can be measured either by using electrophysiological techniques or by staining with dyes whose binding is dependent on the membrane potential." ;

Assays\nwere conducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL\nphenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza,\n14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL\ngeneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027).  Following overnight growth, 100 nL of 3.75 mM compound was\nadded to the cell solutions (7.5 uM final [compound]).  The positive control used in this assay was\nstrophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in dose (12-point, 2-fold\ndilution, from 20 uM final [compound]) and was incorporated at the beginning and end of each days\nrun.  Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega,\nE2250) reagent was added.  The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and\nluciferase levels were measured.  \nTaken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07\n1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene\nfusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza,\n12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM\npenstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD\nFalcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h).\n2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro,\n25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95%\nhumidity, 5% CO2.  Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. \nThis 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted\nfor 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge.  The media was aspirated and the cell pellet\nwas resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media.

Each run was initiated in\nCBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes\nBiosolutions).  Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system.\nReplicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final\nconcentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions).\n8) Plates with compound were then relidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and\nincubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2.\n9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carosel (LPX 220) and were\nallowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min.\n10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X\nSteady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo mainted at 4 C and warmed to room\ntemperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water\nbath).\n11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carosel and incubated at room temperature\nfor 30 min.\n12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence\nvalues were collected using with 100 ms read time per well.\n13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for agonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of\nfeeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional\nregulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and\nalcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor,\na 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production.\nNPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus\nsolitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile\nand biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is\npredicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission,\nY2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this\nhypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type\ncontrols (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress\nethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure\nand high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6).\nTherefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y2 agonist dose response curves for compounds\nidentified as active in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID\n1359),\n\"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID 1710),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID\n1304), and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (PubChem AID 1703).\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure direct agonism of the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of NPY-Y2 will increase Y2\nactivity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence,\nthus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point,\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic\nmix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG\ncells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well\nof 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were\nincubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2\nmicroliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added\nto the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to\nnormalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-78, for inactive compounds 77-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344870)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors. \nThe present assay was run to confirm the activity of hits from the primary screen.\nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and\npeptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse\nmonoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine (Eu3+-AB) and the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were\npurchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Injury of the brain is a major cause of death and morbidity after the prolonged seizures termed\nstatus epilepticus (SE). Studies in rodents have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)\nactivation by ischemia and SE generally contributes to neuronal injury, but multiple downstream\nCOX2 signaling pathways, and our data, suggest that the mechanisms promoting and opposing brain\ninjury are complex.\nValue of allosteric prostanoid receptor modulators. Given the broad roles of COX2 in inflammation\nand neurodegeneration, and the recognition that interrupting the entire signaling cascade with a\nCOX2 blocker prevents generation of protective as well as harmful prostanoids, it is surprising\nthat there have not been larger advances in the development of agents that selectively target\ndifferent prostanoid receptors. Merck has had some success in development of EP1, EP3 and DP1\nantagonists. However, only one selective agonist for EP2 is known (butaprost), and there are no\nselective EP2 or DP2 antagonists available. An approach to developing highly selective compounds\nthat has been very successful for ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors is to\nsearch for allosteric regulators of receptor function. Allosteric modulators provide spatial and\ntemporal context dependence because they only affect receptor activation in the presence of the\nagonist. This is an important feature for our purpose because the endogenous prostanoids are\ntypically released in a pulsatile fashion in response to a stimulus. Allosteric regulators\ntypically bind to a site on the receptor different from the agonist binding site and so do not\ntarget the typically highly conserved agonist binding pocket. Allosteric regulators are also\ninsensitive to the concentration of agonist and therefore are effective even in the presence of the\nhigh concentrations of released prostaglandins expected during and after seizures. Finally,\nallosteric modulators used as therapeutics provide an additional level of safety in cases of\noverdose because their response typically saturates.\nEP2 is a Gs-coupled GPCR that, when activated, causes an increase in the cellular content of cAMP.\nWe created a rat C6 glioma cell line that stably expresses human EP2 prostanoid receptors under\ncontrol of the CMV promoter. Thirteen subclones were expanded and tested for the ability of 1 uM\nbutaprost (a selective EP2 agonist) and 20 uM forskolin (strong activator of adenylate cyclase) to\ncause cAMP accumulation in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The subclone\nchosen for further study responded to 1 uM butaprost with a 1000-fold increase in cAMP levels (from\n0.057 to 58 fmoles / 6000 cells in a 384 well plate). The parent C6 glioma does not respond to\nbutaprost or the endogenous ligand, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (not shown).\nThe primary cell-based assay depends upon competition by cell-derived cAMP for binding of a\ncAMP-labeled FRET acceptor to a cAMP antibody, which is itself labeled with a FRET donor (HTRF\nassay from CisBio). The FRET signal decreases as cAMP concentration rises. Incubation of cells with\nbutaprost in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, reduces the FRET signal in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the assay was stable when this incubation was carried\nout for 10 or 40 min at room temperature, which provides a comfortable time window for manipulating\ncell culture plates in this assay. The FRET signal itself was stable for at least 12 hours after\nlysing the cells.\nA cell density of 6000 to 9000 cells/well in a 384-well plate yielded optimum screening metrics,\nwith Z' >0.75 and S:N > 15. The assay tolerates up to about 2% DMSO. The natural agonist, PGE2, is\napproximately 7-fold more potent than butaprost, and will be used in HTS because the action of\nallosteric modulators is frequently influenced by the agonist chosen. \nPositives from the primary screen, AID 940, were chosen for testing in this confirmatory\ndose-response assay.\nReagents:\nCell culture medium: 500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen\nStrept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml Geneticin\nProcedure:\n1. Grow cells:\nCells were grown over a week in T-175 flasks and split when appropriate to reach the final volume\nof 40-50 T-175 flasks necessary for screening.\n2. Harvest cells:\n1.

Run 5 plates/batch from refrigerator.\n5. Data analysis:\nData analysis:\n1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios:\nFRET ratio = F665 nm / F615 nm * 10000\nF665 nm: Fluorescence counts at 665 nm emission (units: cps)\nF620 nm: Fluorescence counts at 615 nm emission (units: cps)\n2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of inhibition is\ncalculated with the following equation based on normalized data from each plate.\nNormalized FRET signal = ((FRET compound well - FRET blank(compound added)) / ((FRET compound well\n- FRET background) (no compound added))\n% of activity = (Normalized FRET signal from compound well / average normalized FRET signal from\ncontrol wells) * 100\n% of inhibition = 100 - % of activity\nWhere FRET compound well is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET background is an\naverage FRET ratio from wells with cells, Anti-cAMP-Eu and HBSS buffer only; FRET control is an\naverage FRET ratio from wells containing 0.3 nM PGE2 that defines maximum FRET signal.\nPercent induction is then calculated based on a comparison with wells containing 1 uM PGE2:\n% induction = (Pct Inhibition Compound / Pct Inhibition 1 uM PGE2) * 100\n8 different concentrations of PGE2 were tested, and 3 different compound concentrations were\napplied to each 8-concentration set of PGE2 curves, to assess the impact of each compound on the\nPGE2 dose-curve.\nA 4 parameter logistic equation is fit to the PGE2 curves using software from the R project for\nstatistical analysis:\nY = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(conc/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom\nDose response curves were obtained for PGE2 at 0 uM compound concentration and at 6.7 uM and 20 uM\ncompound concentration.\nThe PGE2 EC50s at 0, 6.7 and 20 uM compound concentrations were compared to see if each assayed\ncompound caused a significant shift in the PGE2 EC50.  After visual inspection of the curves, an\nempirical formula was determined to mark active compounds.  \nCompounds were marked as Active if:\nPGE2 EC50 @ 20 uM > 0.05\nPGE2 EC50 @ 20 uM < 0.31\nCurve Slope  @ 20 uM > -1.5\nCurve Slope @ 20 uM < 0.5\nCurve Bottom @ 20 uM < 40\nCompounds which were marked as Active were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100.  Inactive\ncompounds were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.\nThe field \"Active Concentration\" was set to 20 uM for active compounds.\n" ;

For example the primary assay, which is performed first, identifies hits. The primary hits are then confirmed in a confirmatory assay.  Subsequent secondary assays are run to eliminate compounds that are not of interest or to confirm hits using an alternate design / technology, or to further characterize compounds.\nWhether an assay is run in single concentration or concentration response is defined in the class 'assay measurement throughput quality'.  For example primary assays are typically run in single concentration with single measurements. However, the NCGC runs qHTS primary assays as concentration-response assays." ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases.\n\nRas and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the\nUniversity of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral\nphenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the\npiperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring\nother heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with\npiperidine.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25\nmM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.\nThe positive control used in this assay was strophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG,\nLot#038K1036), which was used in-plate (32 wells at 20 uM final [compound]).  Cells were grown for\n48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega, E2250) reagent was\nadded. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase levels were\nmeasured.\n1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the Prion protein (PRP) 5'UTR-Luciferase gene\nfusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza,\n12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM\nPen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD\nFalcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h).\n2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro,\n25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95%\nhumidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This\n10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3\nmin at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was\nresuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below).\n3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing\n72 h for cells to grow to confluency.\n4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep(Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media\nprewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles.\n5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50\nuL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized\ndispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood.\n6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an offline Liconic\n(STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight.\n7) Screening was performed using walk-up instrumentation. Each run was initiated in CBIP (Broad\nChemical Biology Informatics Platform). In groups of 22, assay plates were delidded and stacked. \nThey were then individually pinned with 100 nL compounds, which were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold\ndilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final compound\nconcentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Many cellular pathways leading to activation of NF-kB-family transcription factors have been\nidentified to be participating in host-defense, immunity, inflammation, and cancer. Recently, a\nunique pathway activated by antigen receptors on T- and B-Lymphocytes has been revealed, involving\na cascade of participating proteins that includes CARMA1 (BIMP3), Bcl-10, paracaspase (MALT1),\nTRAF6, and Ubc13. This pathway is initiated by Protein Kinase C-theta, which induces\nphosphorylation of components of this signaling pathway. Based on experiments using siRNA and\ndominant-negative mutants, it has been determined that treatment of cells with the combination of\nphorbol ester PMA and the calcium-ionophore Ionomycin triggers this pathway, resulting in NF-kB\nactivation. Compounds able to block this stimulation will be useful research tools for\nanalysis of the physiological roles of this NF-kB activation pathway.\n\nThis assay utilizes HEK-293 cells that have been stably transfected with the mammalian expression\nplasmid pUC13-4xNFkB-Luc, allowing the expression of the firefly luciferase under the control of\nfour tandem HIV NFkB response elements. As previously described, stimulation with a PMA/Ionomycin\nmix results in NF-kB activation, thus increasing luciferase expression and luminescence levels\nmeasured with an appropriate substrate. Compounds that decrease light emission are potential\ninhibitors and may be able to block the NF-kB activation triggered by the PMA/Ionomycin\nstimulation, hence providing valuable tools to decipher this new pathway.\nThe primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 3\nmicromolar final concentration.\n\nHEK-293 stably transfected with the pUC13-4xNFkB-Luc were cultured in T-175 flasks (Corning\npart#431080) at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative humidity.\nThe growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen part# 11965-092)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30088), 1% v/v\npenicillin-streptomycin mix (Invitrogen part#15140-122) and 1ug/mL puromycin (InvivoGen\npart#ant-pr-1).\nPrior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 625,000 cells per milliliter in\nphenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen part# 21063-029) supplemented with\n10% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30088), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin\nmix (Invitrogen part#15140-122) and 1ug/mL puromycin (InvivoGen part#ant-pr-1). \nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well (i.e. 2,500 cells/well)\nof a white solid-bottom 1536-well plate (Kalypsys part# K1536 SWST)\nPlates were then placed in the incubator overnight at 37 degrees Celsius, 5%CO2 and 95% relative\nhumidity.\nTwenty four hours after seeding, cells were treated with 15 nL/well of compounds (3 micromolar,\nfinal DMSO concentration of 0.30%).

Binding\nreactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 ug of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final,\nto define total binding) or 1uM atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500\nul. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in\nDMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final\nDMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction.

For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an\nacetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations\n(3 to 30uM, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after\ncounting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to\napproximately 5% or less.\n\nData from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum\nspecific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and\nfitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no\nweighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30\nmicromolar did not fit a full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive\nstatistics could not be determined.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen to\ndetermine whether these compounds are nonselective antagonists due to inhibition of S1P1. This\nassay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription\nfactor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein\nand a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation\nof the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through\nproteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus,\nwhere it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA\nsubstrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit S1P1 activation\nand migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA\ntranscription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4\nmicroliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO\nalone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the\nappropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the\nincubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nInhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 45 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 45 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG-1-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy#s 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH)\nfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).  We have identified small molecule inhibitors of BAP1\nusing a kinetic, fluorescence intensity high-throughput screen.  In this assay, ubiquitin\nconjugated to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC) is used as a BAP1 substrate.  Hydrolysis of UbAMC by\nBAP1 results in the release of free AMC and an increase in fluorescence.  The reaction velocity is\nmeasured as the increase in fluorescence over time and is proportional to BAP1 activity.  Compounds\nidentified in the initial single-dose screen have been confirmed in dose response using the same\nassay format.  To date, UbAMC is the only substrate commercially available for in vitro DUB\nactivity assays.  However, the excitation/emission wavelengths of AMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm)\noverlap with those of many small molecules, which leads to a high percentage of fluorescence\nartifacts.  To overcome the problem of interference by compound autofluorescence, we replaced UbAMC\nwith ubiquitin-rhodamine(110)-glycine (UbRHO).  The excitiation/emission wavelegths of RHO (ex. 485\nnm, em. 520 nm) are right-shifted compared to those of AMC and has less overlap with\nautofluorescent compounds.  RHO also generates a much stronger fluorescent signal, which greatly\nincreases assay sensitivity, signal-to-background ratio, and allows for the use of less substrate. \nIn this assay, compounds were tested side by side in dose response in both UbAMC and UbRHO assays. \nMany compounds that exhibited autofluorescence in the UbAMC assay did not in the UbRHO assay.  \nResyntheses and analogs of MLSMR hits identified in the primary screen (AID 436) were tested in\nthis assay.  Each compound was tested at 8 concentrations, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a\nnominal test concentration of 100 uM. Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  Of 35 compounds\ntested in the UbAMC assay, 27 were repeated in the UbRHO assay.  \n\n1. Dilute BAP1, Ub-AMC, and UbRHO (provided by assay PI) in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM\nNaCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 5 mM DTT).  Keep on ice.\n2. Add 25 ul of BAP1 (5 nM final) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls.\n3. Transfer 1 uL compounds to 384-well plate to arrive at final compound concentrations.\n4. Add 25 ul of 800 nM Ub-AMC (400 nM final) or 100 nM UbRHO (50 nM final).\n5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using kinetic\nsettings.  The plate was read every 1 minute 45 seconds for 10 readings.  \n6.  All compounds were tested in triplicate\nA 400 nm dichroic mirror was used for UbAMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm), and a 505 nm dichroic mirror\nwas used for UbRHO (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm). \n\n" ;

This cell-based reporter assay\nemploys a human DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line that is stably transfected with a plasmid\ncontaining 2.0 kb of the human KLF5 promoter used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase\nreporter gene (DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p). Cells are seeded in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for one\nday, followed by incubation with test compounds. Luciferase activity is monitored using a\nluminescent detection reagent, which contains the luciferase substrate D-luciferin that releases\nlight energy upon conversion to oxyluciferin in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and oxygen. As designed,\ncompounds that inhibit KLF5 expression will reduce the activity of the KLF5 promoter, thereby\nreducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene and luciferase protein levels, resulting in\ndecreased conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, and reduced well luminescence.

        bat:hasParagraph  "This functional assay was developed for detection of compounds inhibiting the replication of\nVenezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus(VEEV), strain V3526-luc. The virus expresses a functional\nluciferase while it is actively replication in host cells and the signal is proportional to the\nextent of the virus replication. \nThe goal of the proposed project is to find probes specific to the West Nile viruses, therefore it\nis important to confirm the antiviral spectrum of the confirmed compounds to other viruses at a\nlater stage. Antiviral compounds show different activity spectra to related or unrelated viruses\ndepending on the specificity and mechanism of action of the compounds. Hence, the assay was\nimplemented as a counter screen to the West Nile Virus anti-viral assay. This would provide the\ncharacteristics of the probe\ncandidates for anti-WNV compounds. The assay measures a luciferase activity expressed in Vero 76\ncells by V3526-luc virus infection using luminescence as the end point. A luciferase gene is\nencoded in the nsP3 gene in-frame so the activity is proportional to virus replication in the\nsystem. The screen for inhibitors of a luciferase expression in V3526-luc infected cells involves\nchallenging 4,500 cells with V3526-luc virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.06 in the\npresence of the compounds to be screened. The V3526-luc virus was prepared from BHK cells\ntransfected with genomic infectious RNA at the SRI BSL-2 facility. The assay includes both cell and\nvirus controls. The activity was measured 24 h post virus addition using BrightGlo luciferase\nreagent (Promega). Percent luciferase activity was calculated by using mean luminescence values of\nthe virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the virus-infected cell control x\n100. The percent cell viability was taken as an assessment of antiviral activity. \nCell Culture: Vero 76 cells were cultured in Eagles modified MEM (E-MEM) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10%\nFBS and 100 U of penicillin, 100 ug of streptomycin per mL (culture media). The cells are\nmaintained at 37C, 5.0% CO2 to 100% confluence being passaged every four days. For cell plating,\ncells were detached from flask bottom by using Trypsin-EDTA solution and then re-suspended in a\ngrowth media\nVEEV culture: VEEV strain,V3526-luc was used for screening. The V3526-luc stock was prepared in\nBHK-21 cells. The plasmid which encodes whole genome of V3526 and luciferase gene has been created\nby Dr. Brett Beitzel at USAMRIID.  The stock virus was prepared by a process of rescuing virus from\ninfectious RNAs. The infectious genomic RNA was generated from the linearized plasmid DNA,\npV3526-luc, in conjunction with 7mG cap analogue by using in vitro RNA transcription. The RNA was\nthen delivered into BHK C-21 cells by electrophoration and the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C\nwith 5% CO2 until cytopathic effect was seen (4 days). Culture media was then collected and\nclarified by centrifugation. 1.5 mL aliquots of the media were stored at -80 degrees C as stock\nvirus.  \nDose Response Compound Preparation and Controls: The compounds were tested in a dose response\nformat using a 1:2 serial dilution with the highest concentrations starting at 133.3uM and 66.6uM\ndepending on the stock concentrations available.  A total of ten concentrations were generated for\nthe dose response curve with the lowest concentrations of 0.26uM and 0.13uM, respectively.  Carrier\ncontrol (DMSO) and compounds were diluted in assay media to 6x and 5uL was dispensed to assay\nplates.  The final DMSO in the assay for all screening concentrations was 0.33%   \nCell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 4,500 cells/well\nwere plated in 15 uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and\nhigh humidity. \nVirus Addition: V3526-luc was diluted in the culture media to 30000 TCID50/ml and 10 uL was added\nto the compound wells and the virus control wells (0.06 TCID50/ cell). Media only (mock virus) was\nadded to the cell control wells. All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class\nII Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated in an actively\nhumidified incubator with 5.0% CO2 at 37C for 24 hrs. \nEndpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an\nequal volume of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for\n10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label\nreader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-3 facility. \nData Analysis: Thirty two control wells containing cells only  (Cell control),  twenty four wells\ncontaining cells and virus (Virus control) were included on each assay plate and used to calculate\nZ' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. And also eight wells\ncontaining cells, virus and control drug, Mycophenolic Acid at 5 uM were included on each assay\nplate. The percent inhibition of virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was calculated as: 100*(Cmpd\nLum - Median Virus Ctrl)/(Median Cell Ctrl - Med Virus Ctrl). Percent inhibition values were used\nto calculate EC50 values for the compounds by using4 parameter regression curve analysis with\nActivityBase.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous\nsystem resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose\ncontribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated.\nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor\n(KOR). This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in\n\"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nThis image-based KOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the\narrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to\ncoated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the\nGFP-arrestins.\n\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR1\nreceptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics\n- 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution:  (Dynorphin-A, American Peptide #24450 - 5mM stock in DMSO)\ndiluted in water to 10uM.  \n5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO (Sigma D8418)\n6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO\n7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer\n(10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAssay Procedure:\n1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of\ncompounds. \n4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Addiction leading to abuse should  be treatable by pharmacological approaches, and programs that\nidentify new drugs to treat methamphetamine abuse address an immediate goal of the National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) that new approaches are needed for treating METH addiction.\nCurrently, small molecule drug-like compounds are not available for treating METH abuse.\nNeurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) peptide agonists produce behaviors that are exactly opposite to the\npsychostimulant effects observed with methamphetamine abuse, such as hyperactivity, neurotoxicity,\npsychotic episodes, and cognitive deficits, and repeated administrations of NTR1 agonists do not\nlead to the development of tolerance [2]. These data form the basis of the idea that neurotensin\nreceptors are valid targets for antagonizing drug seeking behaviors and preventing relapses. We\npropose to identify novel small molecule neurotensin receptor agonists by screening libraries of\ncompounds using a primary assay based upon the ability of a b-arrestin fluorescent reporter to\ndirectly recognize the activated state of the NTR1.\nThe specific aim of this primary assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the Neurotensin 1\nReceptor (NTR1) using a b-arrestin high throughput, high content primary assay.\n\nThis assay is to identify agonists that activate the neurotensin receptor-1 pathway by detecting of\nspots of-arrestin-GFP in NTR1-U2OS Osteosarcoma Cells.\n\nDescription  Source  Cat\nNTR1-U2OS osteosarcoma cells  Dr. Lawrence Barak, Duke University  N/A\nMEM medium  Cellgro/Mediatech  15-010-CM\nFetal Bovine Serum  Hyclone  SH30396.03\nPenicillin Streptomycin solution  Omega Scientific  PS-20\nL-Glutamine  Mediatech  25-005-CL\nG418 (100 mg/mL)  Invivogen  ant-gn-1\nZeocin (100 mg/mL)  Invitrogen  R250-01\nT225 Tissue Culture flasks  Corning  431082\nDPBS  Cellgro  21-031CV\nTrypsin-EDTA 0.05%  Invitrogen  25300\n1536 well black clear bottom plate  Aurora Biotechnology  29326\nNTR1 peptide  Sigma  N6383\nParaformaldehyde  Acros Organics  30528954\nHoechst 33342 (10 mg/mL)  Invitrogen  H3570\nC.

Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed to each test well of\n1536-well plates (1000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours. \nAfter this incubation, 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (5 uM final nominal concentration; 0.5% final\nDMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells.  Then, 1 ul of PBS (control wells) or thapsigargin in PBS (positive control wells; 500 nM\nfinal concentration) was added to the appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed\ninto sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2,\nfollowed by addition of 1 ul per well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM\nProbenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Late-stage fluorescence dose response cell-based counterscreening assay for agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): inhibition by S1P4-selective antagonist.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether a test compound with S1P4 agonist activity is\ninhibited by an S1P4-selective antagonist. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain\nthe human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription\nfactor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein\nand a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation\nof the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through\nproteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus,\nwhere it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA\nsubstrate. The presence of an S1P4-selective antagonist compound in the assay inhibits S1P4\nactivation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA\ntranscription, leading to no increase in well FRET. In the presence of a test agonist compound, the\nS1P4 receptor will be stimulated, leading to an increase in well FRET. Compound was tested in\ntriplicate using a 7-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 10 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth\nmedia consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM\nNEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200\nug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, and 100 ug/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The\nnext day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final\nconcentration) was added to control wells. Next, 370 nM S1P4-selective antagonist SR2-304 was added\nto the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the\nincubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control\n- Median_High_Control ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and SR2-304.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing SR2-304.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 10 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 10 uM. \nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >= 50% at any test\nconcentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by\nthe potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100. There are no inactive compounds.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nS1P4-selective antagonist SR2-304 (provided by SRIMSC)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogeneous Time\nResolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 2\nreceptor (OX2R; HCRTR2), run by assay provider.\n\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify\nantagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)\" (AID 485270), and that confirmed activity in a\nprevious set of experiments entitled, \"Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based\ncell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R;\nHCRTR1)\" (AID 492964) are non-selective due to activation of OX2R.\nThis assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that\nstably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX2R/Hcrtr2 (CHO-OX2R). This receptor signals through\nphospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production.\nCryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of\nreceptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX2R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1\nantibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the\nantibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX2R activation stimulates\nendogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to\nthe labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX2R/Hcrtr2\nantagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1\navailable to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the\nlabeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate\nusing a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO/OX2R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media\nconsisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified\nfetal bovine serum, , 10 ug/mL Blasticidin.\nThe day of the assay, 15000 cells in 7 uL of 1X Stimulation Buffer were seeded into each well of\n384-well low volume plates, spun down at 300 rpm for 1 minute. Plates were then incubated for a\ncouple of hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 until time of Assay. Then, 3.5 uL of test compound (4X\nconcentration) in 1X Stimulation buffer 2%DMSO and antagonist controls were added to the\nappropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 3.5 uL of\nOrexin-A agonist (4X concentration) in 1X Stimulation Buffer and 0.5% DMSO (EC90 average response\nwere dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH,\n3 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was\nadded to each well. Next, 3 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and plates were incubated at room\ntemperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm\nbandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm\n(with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Plates were\nread in Perkin Elmer Envision instrument with 665/620 filter set recommended by Cisbio Protocol.\nThe IP-One ratio was calculated by:\n( 665_nm / 620_nm * 10,000 )\nIn this assay, test compounds are wells containing test compound, low controls are wells containing\n1X Stimulation buffer and 0.5% DMSO, and high controls are wells containing Agonist Orexin A 5 uM.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration using\nGraphPad Prism. The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the\nX-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest\nconcentration tested (i.e. 100 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was\ndetermined manually as greater than 100 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nActivity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest\nactivity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-68 and for inactive compounds 63-0.\nList of Reagents:\nDRxCHO (parental cell lines provided by Discover X)\nDRxOX2R cells (made In-house with HCRTR1/HCRTR2 Pro-link constructs)\nIP-One Tb Kit (Cisbio, part 62IPAPEJ)\nHam's F-12 media (Invitrogen, part 11765-054)\nBlasticidin (Invitrogen part, R21001)Versene solution (Invitrogen, part 15040)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nAmphotericin B Mix (HyClone part, SV30079)T-175 tissue culture flasks (VWR, part 660-175)\nAgonist: Orexin A peptide (Tocris, part 1455)\nAntagonist: SB-334867-A (Tocris, part 1960)\nAntagonist: SR-8809 (synthesized in-house)\n384-well low-volume plates (Greiner, part 784080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gamma is a transcription factor that has a central\nrole in the differentiation of Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells that secrete the inflammatory\ncytokines IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells have been implicated in graft versus host disease,\nautoimmune disease and asthma. ROR gamma is induced in naive T helper cells in the presence of\nTGF-beta combined with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23, and thereafter directs the expression of the Th17\nlineage cytokines. To study the mechanism of action of ROR gamma, an insect cell-based assay was\nscreened. This Drosophila Schneider cell line was stably transfected with two vectors: a gene\nexpressing a fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and ROR gamma transactivation domain under the\ncontrol of the metallothionine promoter and a Photinus luciferase reporter regulated by the Gal4\nbinding site enhancer, UAS. The addition of copper to the medium induced expression of the Gal4-ROR\ngamma fusion that subsequently induced the UAS-luciferase reporter. Small molecule inhibitors of\nROR gamma activity are detected by a decrease in luciferase reporter activity.\n\nFor screening, 600 cells in 4 uL/well were dispensed into white solid 1536-well plates (Grenier)\nusing a solenoid-based dispenser. Following transfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin\ntool, the plates were incubated 1 hr at ambient temperature, and 1 uL/well copper sulfate (700 uM\nfinal concentration) was added. The plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 20 hr at\nambient temperature. After addition of 1.5 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates\nwere incubated 10 min at ambient temperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect\nluminescence.\n" ;

Recent studies by collaborators and us\nsuggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial\nlesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. \nThis biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate\nphosphate from p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"HTS\nColorimetric assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit VHR1\" (AID 1992) and to study\nthe structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired\nfrom commercial sources or synthesized internally.\n\nKi Determination.

The enzyme was preincubated with various fixed concentrations of\ninhibitors for 10 min.  The reaction was initiated by addition of various concentrations of pNPP\n(ranging from 0.2 to 10 Km) to the reaction mixture.  The initial rate was determined using an\nELx808 micro plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.), reading the absorbance of the product\np-nitrophenol at 404 nm.  The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring\nthe control without addition of enzyme.  The inhibition constant and inhibition pattern was\nevaluated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equations for either competitive,\nuncompetitive or mixed inhibition as described before (1), using nonlinear regression and the\nprogram GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

RWG biosensor utilizes an optical beam with an appropriate angular content to illuminate a waveguide film in which a grating structure is embedded. When this beam is reflected by the sensor surface, the resonant angle dominates in the output beam. The mass redistribution within the sensing volume alters the incident angle. Because of its ability for multiparameter measurements, the biosensor has potential to provide high information content for cell sensing.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The GHMP kinase family is a unique class of important enzymes that plays an essential role in many\nmetabolic processes. It contains more than 170 protein members among which are the galactokinase\n(GALK) and the CMK enzymes. GALK plays a crucial role in galactose processing and is a potential\ntherapeutic target for Classic Galactosemia (OMIM: 230400) [1]. CMK is involved for the\nnon-mevalonate synthesis of isoprenoids precursors and natural products like sterols or ubiquinones\nwhich are important to many biological functions [2].   Although the sequence identity between GALK\nand CMK  is low, the three-dimensional structures and active sites are highly similar [3].\nTherefore to determine the validity and selectivity of an active compound observed in the GALK qHTS\nscreen (AID: 1868), a bioluminescent counter-screen targeting bacterial CMK was developed.  In\naddition, because the mevalonate independent synthesis of isoprenoids are more prevalent in\nopportunistic pathogens such as bacteria [4], CMK is a potential novel therapeutic target where\nselective inhibitors could be used to  determine potential antibacterial effects. \nThe CMK (provided by Kent Lai) was assayed using ATP and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol\n(CDP-ME; Echelon, cat# I-M052) as substrates.  Promega Kinase-Glo Plus (cat# V3774) technology was\nused to detect the residual ATP following kinetic reaction. Briefly, the Kinase-Glo Plus contains\nUltra-Glo [5] luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the\nremaining ATP. Kinase reactions run with and without the enzyme were use as negative and positive\ncontrols together with treatment of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase CD45 inhibitor (EMD Bioscience\ncat# 540215) which is observed to weakly inhibit the CMK. \n\nThree uL/well of substrate solution (15 uM ATP, 30 uM CDP-ME, 20 mM HEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM\nKCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was dispensed into 1536-well, assay plates (Greiner,\nsolid white medium-binding plates) with Aurora Discovery BioRAPTR Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD;\nBeckton-Dickenson). Compound and control solutions (23 nL) were transferred to the assay plate\nusing the Kalypsys 1536-pin tool. One uL/well enzyme solution (0.25 ug/mL CDP-Me kinase, 20 mM\nHEPES pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA final concentration) was then added using\nthe FRD yielding a total kinase reaction volume of 4 uL/ well. After 1 hour of room temperature\nincubation, 4 uL Kinase-Glo Plus reagent was added for a final assay volume of 8 uL/well. After 1\nmin, luminescence was detected with the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using a 1\nsec exposure time and 2x binning settings. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Homeostasis of cellular proteins is maintained through a combination of synthesis and degradation.\nThe pathway that accounts for the majority of protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasomal\npathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) is highly conserved in all cells and the generation of a multi-Ub chain\ntypically targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitination is highly\nreversible and dynamic. Deubiquitination, the reverse process, is catalyzed through the action of\nenzymes referred to as isopeptidases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2]. This group of\nenzymes is collectively responsible for maintaining adequate pools of free ubiquitin and regulating\nthe ubiquitination status of cellular proteins. The class of DUBs referred to as the\nubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) family functions endoproteolytically to cleave Ub chains from a\nwide range of protein substrates. USP2a deubiquitinates fatty acid synthase (FASN) which has\nrecently been identified as an emerging oncology target [3-6]. To identify inhibitors of USP2a a\ncell-free assay was employed.\nThis assay takes advantage of attaching an Ub or UBL (ubiquitin-like protein) to a reporter enzyme,\nrendering the reporter catalytically inactive. The reporter enzyme chosen is phospholipase A2\n(PLA2), which has an absolute requirement for a free amino terminus. Thus, fusion of a UBL to the\nN-terminus of PLA2 inactivates PLA2. When the UBL-PLA2 reporter enzyme is cleaved by USP2, the\nactivated reporter can subsequently act on its substrate, which is the commercially available NBD\nC6-HPC (Invitrogen). Thus, this coupled assay gives a fluorescent read-out, which is generated\nthrough the cleavage of the PLA2 reporter enzyme. The assay, developed by Progenra, Inc. uses\nUb-PLA2 and USP2a at near equal and low (nM) amounts and has been licensed for sale by LifeSensors,\nInc. as the Ub-IsoPro1 kit.\n\nThe assay buffer, prepared fresh at the day of the assay, contains 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2mM CaCl2,\n2mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, 0.1% DMSO. 3ul of 40nM (20nM final) USP2 core, which is stored on ice, is\ndispensed into a medium-binding black solid Kalypsys 1,536 well plate using the Kalypsys dispenser.\nThe assay plate is then pinned with 23nL compound with the Kalypsys pintool in columns 5-48. The\ncontrols are pinned as follows: column 1&2 two-fold dilutions of 2M NEM in duplicate; column 3\nDMSO; column 4 2M NEM (final concentration 38.2mM). The assay plate is incubated at RT for 30min.\nSubsequently, 3uL of 40nM (20nM final) Ub-PLA2 and 40uM (20uM final) NBD C6-HPC (stored on ice and\nprotected from light) were dispensed into the plate using the Kalypsys dispenser. Plates were read\nimmediately (0 Hour) on an Envision (Perkin Elmer) plate reader using the following wavelengths Ex\n460nm /Em 535nm. Then, the assay plates were incubated for 2.5 hours and read again on the Envision\nusing the same settings\nData were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (NEM). Concentration-response curves were fitted to\nthe normalized data and the concentration-response curves were then classified based on curve\nquality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. The time zero reading was used to\nflag fluorescence artifacts.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha); Neubig and Siderovski, 2002].\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS19 that value had been determined to be 107\nnanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute\nvalue of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account\nthe Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases\n\nThe objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule\nregulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760,\n761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to\nmultiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened\nagainst the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases\nincluding wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP.\nThe assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A\nset of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.\nIn the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets\nwere characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of\nfluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the\npresence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control.\nEach protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on\nGSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min\nat 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the\nsame buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by\nincubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or\n10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold\nBODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer\nin the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery.\nMeasured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular\nequivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the\nfollowing equation;\nkMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept\nwhere MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are\nkiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5\ndifferent levels of calibration beads.\nThe resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in\nGraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation;\nkMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP)\nwhere ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP\nper bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: Fluorescence-based biochemical high-throughput\ndose response assay for compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for HCV NS3\nhelicase inhibitors: biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that cause\nfluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) in triplicate\" (AID 1945). This assay also serves as a\ncounterscreen for \"Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to\nidentify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)\", (AID 1800)\nto determine whether the compounds are nonselective due to direct DNA binding. In this biochemical\nassay, a DNA hairpin oligonucleotide is incubated with test compound and a fluorescent\nintercalating agent, ethidium bromide. Upon binding to the DNA molecule, the fluorescence of the\nintercalating agent increases. As designed, test compounds that bind to the DNA molecule will\ncompete with and displace the intercalating agent, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence.\nCompounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 79.4 micromolar. \nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 6.5) were\ndispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO, diminazene\naceturate (80 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) were added\nto the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing into all wells 2.5 microliters of\nAssay Buffer supplemented with 4 micromolar ethidium bromide and 0.32 micromolar hairpin\noligonucleotide. Well fluorescence was read after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on\nthe Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer).\nThe percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:\nPercent Displacement = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / (\npositive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing diminazene aceturate.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 79.4 micromolar) did\nnot result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50/ was determined manually as greater than 79.4\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for inactive compounds is 100-0. There are no actives.\nList of Reagents:\nDNA hairpin oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc, custom synthesized)\nIntercalating agent (Ethidium Bromide) (Bio-Rad, part 161-0433)\nDiminazene Aceturate (Sigma-Aldrich, part D7770)\nMOPS (Fisher-Biotech, part BP308-100)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789173)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\nAgents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\n(mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving\ncognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with\nthese agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients\nwith AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist,\nxanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that\nmAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from\nschizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders.\nEvidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1\nmAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have\nfailed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects\nassociated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective\ncompounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical\neffects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable\ncandidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects.\nPrevious attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other\nspecific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and\ndifficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major\nadvances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding\nsite [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be\nhighly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective\nagonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor\nrather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and\nprovide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4].\n\nThe purpose of this assay was to test the lead compound against a broad panel of targets to\ndetermine ancillary activity.\nMDS Pharma (The Triad, 2200 Renaissance Blvd, Suite 400, King of Prussia, PA 19406-2755) performed\na Lead Profiling Screen of GPCRs, ion channels and transporters against the compound at 10uM\nconcentration. The compond possessed a superior ancillary profile with only three activities >50%\nat 10 uM, and was thus declared an MLSCN probe.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis of\nN-linked oligosaccharide chains. CDG group I (CDG-I) defects are defined as those caused by\nmutations in genes encoding enzymes used for the synthesis and transfer of lipid linked\noligosaccharide (LLO) to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER. The steps in this\npathway and the genes encoding them are very similar from yeast to human. It requires 30-40 single\ngene products, each dependent on the previous step in the linear sequence to produce and transfer\nthe LLO to protein. Therefore, mutations in any step may cause a type of CDG. There is considerable\noverlap in the clinical presentations between different types of CDG and a broad diversity within\neach type. The most common form of CDG, called Type Ia (CDG-Ia), is caused by defects in PMM2\n(Man-6-P to Man-1-P), the gene that encodes phosphomannomutase. Mortality is 20% in the first 5\nyrs, but then patients stabilize. Currently, there is no treatment for the CDG-Ia. \nCDG-Ib patients, who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzing conversion of\nMan-6-P to Fru-6-P, are successfully treated with free mannose. Unfortunately, mannose therapy is\nnot effective for CDG-Ia patients, most likely due to efficient Man-6-P consumption in the PMI\nreaction.  It is believed that patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia)\nwill benefit from dietary mannose if there is a simultaneous reduction of phosphomannose isomerase\n(PMI) activity. This would allow a modest intracellular accumulation of Man-6-P and drive metabolic\nflux into the glycosylation pathway using the residual PMM2 activity. It is assumed that a\nnon-competitive inhibitor would work best in this setting; however, identification of chemical\nprobes with diverse modes of action (MOA) would be advantageous for further characterization of PMI\nand PMM variants.  \nThe purpose of this assay is to identify inhibitors of human PMI.  This is accomplished by using a\nG6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through conversion of its\nproduct, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)\nand subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitant with\nNADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The NADPH is then\ndetected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. \nThis assay is performed in the presence of near-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate,\nmannose-6-phosphate, to ensure the identification of inhibitors with diverse MOAs. \nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"HTS\nidentification of compounds inhibiting phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) via a fluorescence intensity\nassay\" (AID 1209) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed\nhits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nPMI assay materials:\n1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute,\nSan Diego, CA). \n2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.4 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml\nDiaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin.\n3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6\nug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. \nPMI Dose-response confirmation protocol:\n1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate\n(cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix)\n2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive\ncontrol) \n3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial\ndilution.

Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10\nmicromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are\nconsidered active.\n\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved.

The slope of the\nfluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen\nseconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated.\nCurves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ).\nSubsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent\nserial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and\nfit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla,\nCA).\nFor compounds with an average EC50 equal to or greater than 100uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as\n'Inactive' and 'Score' as '1'. For compounds with an average EC50 less than 100uM, 'Outcome' was\nassigned as 'Active.' For compounds with average EC50's less than or equal to 10uM, 'Score' was\nasssigned as '50'. For compounds with average EC50's less than or equal to 1uM, 'Score was assigned\nas '100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by\ntracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line.\nFreshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000\ncells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight\nincubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD\nBioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle)\nbaseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound\nlibrary (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1\ncycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds\nwhich activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists).\nFollowing the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC20 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head.\nMeasurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the\nproduction of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in\nintracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET\n(time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled\nwith Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer\nand the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating\na TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The\nnative unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding\nand reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled\nmolecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be\ndetected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620\nnm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was\nsuccessfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format.\nSelect compounds from the primary screen (AID 1461) were chosen for confirmation based on potency,\nefficacy, SAR, and activity across other assays in PubChem and at NCGC. Other compounds are analogs\nof active compounds from the primary screen. This particular assay uses a high density of sampling\nacross concentration-response space to establish more confidence estimates of potency.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained\nfrom Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both\nthe ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620.\nData were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS\ncontrol). IC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard\nHill equation.\nNPS 1536-well assay protocol:\n(1) Fresh or frozen CHO-NPSR cells were suspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 %\nFBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4 ul/well (1200\ncells) to white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16\nto 30 hours.\n(2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between\n0.6 nM and 46 uM.\n(3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 500 uM RO-201724\n(Sigma-Aldrich, B8279), 1.5% Alexa 647-labeled anti-cAMP antibody (from Perkin Elmer), 100 nM NPS)\n(4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min.\n(5) Add 1 ul/well detection reagent. Detection reagent was prepared by adding biotin labeled cAMP\n(4%), streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate (1.33%) and TritonX-100 (1%) to detection\nbuffer. Biotin labeled cAMP, streptavidin labeled with Europium-W8044 chelate and detection buffer\nall came from the LANCE cAMP kit (Perkin Elmer).\n(6) Incubate at room temperature for 2 hours.\n(7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. \nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. \nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\nCHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M5  were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4\nAM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS\n(Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All\ncompounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was\nthen added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was\nprepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium\nmobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)\naccording to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for\n1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec\nwith a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and\nthen as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were\ndetermined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression\n(variable slope).\nFor compounds with an average EC50 greater than 30uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and\n'Score' was assigned as '0'. For compounds with an average EC50 less than 30uM, 'Outcome' was\nassigned as 'Active'. The 'Score' for compounds with average EC50s greater than or equal to 1uM was\nassigned as '50' and for less than 1uM as '100'.\n" ;

Compounds were tested in six replicates in a\n7-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 20 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThis assay was started by dispensing U2OS cells in McCoy's 5A medium plus 10% FBS, penicillin\n100U/ml and streptomycin 100 ug/ml (20 uL, 200,000 cells/well) into the wells of a 384-well plate.\nEight 1:3 serial dilutions of compound (100 uM in growth media) were made. 5uL of diluted compound\nor media were added to wells, giving final compound concentrations of 0 - 20 uM. The plate was spun\nfor 1 minute at 1000 rpm, then incubated at 37 C in a humidified incubator for 6 hours, then\nequilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes. 25 uL CellTitre-Glo reagent was added to each\nwell, followed by incubation of the plate in the dark for 10 minutes. Well luminescence was\nmeasured on the Envision plate reader.\nThe % growth inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:\n% Growth Inhibition = ( MedianRFU_High_Control - RFU_Test_Compound ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control -\nMedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing cells in the presence of test compound.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing cells treated with media only (no compound).\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing no cells (media only).\nPercent growth inhibition was plotted against the log of the compound concentration. The CC50 is\nreported as \"> X uM\" (where X = the highest concentration tested for which < 50% growth inhibition\nwas observed).\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with a CC50 value of less than 10 uM were considered active (cytotoxic). Compounds with a\nCC50 value greater than 10 uM were considered inactive (non-cytotoxic).\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. \nActivity score was then ranked by the potency of the compounds with fitted curves, with the most\npotent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.\nList of Reagents:\nU2OS cells (ATCC, part HTB-96)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (Invitrogen, part 16600-082)\nFBS (Invitrogen, part 26140-079)\nPenicillin / Streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nCell Titer-Glo (Promega, part G7572)\n384-well plates (Corning 3570)\n" ;

The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they\nwere declared active in AID 920 and AID 1263; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3\ninhibition\" (AID 862); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay\nfor STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition\" (AID 1303);\nand 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT1\ninhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT3 inhibition\" (AID 1310).\nIn this assay STAT1 inhibition was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably\nexpresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent\nor reduce IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test\ncompounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were\nmonitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 inhibitor will block\nIFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing transcription of the luciferase\nreporter gene, leading to decreased well luminescence.  Compounds were tested in triplicate using a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 micromolar.\n\nThe STAT1 inhibitor and activator dose response assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells were\ngrown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal\nbovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 50\nmicrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 microliters of\nwell-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well\nplates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO,\nnifuroxazide (334 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, or DMSO\nalone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 1\nhour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL\nfinal nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to all wells. The plates\nwere then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by\ndispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well,\nfollowed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the\nViewLux plate reader.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in\nSalmonella that also controls the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables\nSalmonella to determine its presence in an intracellular or extracellular environment, and to\npromote the expression of genes required for survival within or entry into host cells,\nrespectively.  The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes\npresent in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ.  The gene products are members of bacterial\ntwo-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli, and regulate the\nexpression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage survival of S. enterica.  \nDuring the past year Dr. Harris' group has constructed and evaluated multiple PhoP-activated\npromoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of gene\ntranscripts in wild-type serovar Typhi.  They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as\nPhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing verses inducing conditions for\neach of the promoters.  This allowed for the development of a primary screening and\ncounterscreening assays for PhoP-specific inhibitors which may lead to the identification of novel\nstrategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial infection.\nThe inhibition eukaryotic cell culture growth was established using THP1 cells (ATCC Cat. #\nTIB-202), a Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. This counter-screening assay for eukaryotic\nculture growth inhibition was performed after the main confirmatory (dose-response) assay.  This\ncounterscreen assay was cell-based in 384-well plate format and tested the cytotoxicity of\ncompounds only, without the addition of bacteria. \nThis assay was conducted with all 2302 screened in the confirmation and counterscreens.  Compounds\nwere plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the\naddition of cells.  Cells were grown and incubated with compounds in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10%\nFBS, for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for\nviability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a\ndecreased luminescent signal.  Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in\nthis screen.  \nCell viability was calculated relative to the mean of the cell control. Viability at each of 10\ntested concentrations ranging from 50 uM to 0.1 uM. Compounds that showed cell viability < 80% were\nconsidered Active (or Toxic). EC50 values were calculated only for active compounds using a 4\nparameter Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm, with the maximum and minimum locked at 0 and 100\nrespectively.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors. \nThe present assay confirms compound activity in a cell-based assay of MLL leukemia cell growth\ninhibition using three different cell lines: MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), ML-2 (MLL-AF6), and KOPN-8\n(MLL-ENL).\nInhibition of cell proliferation in the MLL leukemia cells: MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), ML-2 (MLL-AF6) KOPN-8\n(MLL-ENL) induced by compound measured after 72h treatment, as detected by the MTT cell viability\nassay.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Homeostasis of cellular proteins is maintained through a combination of synthesis and degradation.\nThe pathway that accounts for the majority of protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasomal\npathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) is highly conserved in all cells and the generation of a multi-Ub chain\ntypically targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitination is highly\nreversible and dynamic. Deubiquitination, the reverse process, is catalyzed through the action of\nenzymes referred to as isopeptidases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2]. This group of\nenzymes is collectively responsible for maintaining adequate pools of free ubiquitin and regulating\nthe ubiquitination status of cellular proteins. The class of DUBs referred to as the\nubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) family functions endoproteolytically to cleave Ub chains from a\nwide range of protein substrates. USP2a deubiquitinates fatty acid synthase (FASN) which has\nrecently been identified as an emerging oncology target [3-6].

        bat:hasParagraph  "To identify small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERbeta, a competitive binding\napproach using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual\nscreening and derived from the MLSMR as well as other in-house chemical libraries. This assay\nmeasures the ability of small molecules with unknown ERbeta binding affinity to compete with an\nAlexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERbeta in permeabilized whole cells\nexpressing ERbeta-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist\ncharacteristics of molecules that bind ERbeta will be assessed using various secondary assays.\nThe assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6\nCos7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with\nERbeta-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructrions). Twenty-four\nhours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2\nmilliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM\nL-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping\nand resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. \nThe assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains\npositive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells. Columns\n3-22 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in\nligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of\ncells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37\ndegreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM\nNaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH\n6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate\nis incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS\ncontaining 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled\nusing the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward\nscatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while\nE2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). \nPrimary screening was completed at 10 microM as well as 100 nanoM to identify a select number of\nrelatively potent primary hits.\nCalculations:\nAcquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery\nidentifies 384- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population\nis identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for\nanalysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the\nbasis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and\ndefined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen)\nwells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding.\nSample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control\nwells.\nCompounds were considered \"Active\" if they inhibited more than 70% of binding at 10 microM or 65%\nof binding at 100 nanoM. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for \"Actives\" and 1 for\n\"Non-Actives.\"\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding\ncompared with activity cutoff (i.e., 70% for 10 microM and 65% for 100 nanoM). Compounds with\npercent inhibition below activity cutoff (i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for\nActive compounds with percent inhibition above activity cutoff:\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff)\nwhere Cutoff was 70% for 10 microM and 65% for 100 nanoM and %Inhibition was the maximum\n%inhibition above the Cutoff between 10 microM and 100 nanoM experiments. The %Inhibition was\ncalculated by:\n%Inhibition = 100 (1 - Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF)\nwhere Sample MCF was the Median Channel Fluorescence from sample well and Negative Control MCF was\nthe average over assayed plate of Median Channel Fluorescence from the negative control wells\n(i.e., wells with DMSO vehicle only).\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Injury of the brain is a major cause of death and morbidity after the prolonged seizures termed\nstatus epilepticus (SE). Studies in rodents have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)\nactivation by ischemia and SE generally contributes to neuronal injury, but multiple downstream\nCOX2 signaling pathways, and our data, suggest that the mechanisms promoting and opposing brain\ninjury are complex. \n\nEP2 is a Gs-coupled GPCR that, when activated, causes an increase in the cellular content of cAMP.\nWe created a rat C6 glioma cell line that stably expresses human EP2 prostanoid receptors under\ncontrol of the CMV promoter. Thirteen subclones were expanded and tested for the ability of 1 uM\nbutaprost (a selective EP2 agonist) and 20 uM forskolin (strong activator of adenylate cyclase) to\ncause cAMP accumulation in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The subclone\nchosen for further study responded to 1 uM butaprost with a 1000-fold increase in cAMP levels (from\n0.057 to 58 fmoles / 6000 cells in a 384 well plate). The parent C6 glioma does not respond to\nbutaprost or the endogenous ligand, PGE2 (not shown).\nThe primary cell-based assay depends upon competition by cell-derived cAMP for binding of a\ncAMP-labeled FRET acceptor to a cAMP antibody, which is itself labeled with a FRET donor (HTRF\nassay from CisBio). The FRET signal decreases as cAMP concentration rises. Incubation of cells with\nbutaprost in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, reduces the FRET signal in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the assay was stable when this incubation was carried\nout for 10 or 40 min at room temperature, which provides a comfortable time window for manipulating\ncell culture plates in this assay. The FRET signal itself was stable for at least 12 hours after\nlysing the cells. \nA cell density of 6000 to 9000 cells/well in a 384-well plate yielded optimum screening metrics,\nwith Z' >0.75 and S:N > 15. The assay tolerates up to about 2% DMSO. The natural agonist, PGE2, is\napproximately 7-fold more potent than butaprost, and will be used in HTS because the action of\nallosteric modulators is frequently influenced by the agonist chosen. Finally, over the two month\noptimization period the Z' and S:N remained sufficiently robust for screening. \nReagents:\nCell culture medium:  500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen\nStrept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml  Geneticin\nProcedure:\n1.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4).\n\nPandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune\ncell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a\nbioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial\nintegrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related\nhigh affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the\nlungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes,\nresulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus\ninfection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is\nhighly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways\ncould be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is\ncoupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8),\nindicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4\nbiological function.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonist dose response from powder samples.\nCompounds with S1P4 antagonist IC50 less than 1 micromolar in Pubchem AID 1692 were selected based\non presence of a tractable chemical structure and absence of known activities towards other\ntargets.\nThis assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene\n6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also\nexpress a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under\nthe control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration\nof the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor.\nThe liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene.\nBLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a\ncleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4\nantagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing\nproteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were\ntested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of\n50 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10\nmicroliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO\nalone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.22\nmicromolar final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then\nincubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 microliter/well of the\nLiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing\n10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the\ndark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at\nan excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. \nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the\nenumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-99, for inactive 99-0.\nList of Reagents: \nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

Sample wells are assigned a value based on\ntheir E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells using:\n%Binding = 100 * Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF\nwhere Sample MCF is the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from sample well and Negative Control MCF\nis the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from wells with vehicle (DMSO) control. These %Binding\ndata were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear\nleast-squares regression on a sigmoidal dose response model. Some dose response data converged with\nvariable slopes (four parameter logistics equation) and some dose response data converged with Hill\nSlope set to 1 (three parameter logistics equation), see column entitled HILLSLOPE. Curve fit\nstatistics reported concentration of compound at 50% effect (EC50, nanoM), low and high boundaries\nof the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, the Hill Slope, and the correlation\ncoefficient (RSQR) indicative of goodness-of-fit.\nReporting of EC50 estimates were made only for compound data that converged in Prism with a 95%\nconfidence interval. Maximum EC50 reported was set at 10 microM or 10,000 nanoM. Any compound with\nestimate EC50 greater than this cutoff was noted with > in the ACTIVITY_QUALIFIER column.\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was computed based on three parameters of the dose-response curves:\n%Binding at 10 microM, estimated EC50 value, magnitude of binding change over entire concentration\nrange. \nA score of 0-30 was assigned to each compound based on %Binding of fluorescent ligand at the 10\nmicroM point of the dose-response curve, where:\n0 = 70% < %Binding\n10 = 50 < %Binding < 70%\n20 = 30 < %Binding < 50%\n30 = %Binding < 30%\nA score of 0-50 was assigned to each curve based on the estimated EC50 value (in M), where:\n0 = 10^-5 < EC50\n10 = 10^-6 < EC50 < 10^-5\n20 = 10^-7 < EC50 < 10^-6\n30 = 10^-8 < EC50 < 10^-7\n40 = 10^-9 < IC50 < 10^-8\n50 = EC50 < 10^-9\nA score of 0-20 was assigned to each curve based on the magnitude of the dose-response curve of\nE2-Alexa633 binding using: MAGNITUDE = TOP - BOTTOM values from the Prism curve-fit, where:\n0 = MAGNITUDE < 30 or MAGNITUDE > 100\n10 = 30 < MAGNITUDE < 45\n20 = 45 < MAGNITUDE < 100\nThese three scoring parameters were summed to give the possible maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100. \nCompounds were considered \"Active\" if the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was 50 or greater and given\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. \"Non-Active\" compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE less than 50\ngiven PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS\ncan stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster\novary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected\nusing a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS).\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained\nfrom Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in\n1536-well format. For both agonist (1-220s) and antagonist (221-400s) phases, the maximums of\nkinetic fluorescence responses were converted separately into text files using the instrument's\nsoftware data export utility. Data for agonist response were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (NPS). Data for antagonist response were normalized to the\ncontrols for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. \nNPS 1536-well FDSS assay protocol:\n(1) Frozen CHO-NPSR cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's\nmedia supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin.

The two major forms, u-calpain (calpain I) and m-calpain (calpain\nII), are activated by micromolar and millimolar calcium concentrations, respectively.  A current\nand well-supported hypothesis is that cellular injury leads to elevated intracellular calcium and\nprovokes the pathologic activation of calpains.  Activation of calpains is believed to be\nresponsible for the cell death and axonal degeneration seen in many acute and chronic neurological\ndisorders, including stroke, spinal cord and head injuries, and peripheral neuropathies.  Calpain\nactivation leads to degradation of the axonal cytoskeleton, and inhibition of calpains prevents\naxonal degeneration.

Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\n\nCell line creation and culture of the human mGluR4/ Gqi5/CHO line.

A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\nAgents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\n(mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving\ncognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with\nthese agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients\nwith AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist,\nxanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that\nmAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from\nschizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders.\nEvidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1\nmAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have\nfailed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects\nassociated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective\ncompounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical\neffects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable\ncandidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects.\n\nThe purpose of this assay was to screen for M1 antagonists using the human M1 receptor in a calcium\nmobilization assay.\nAssay Info: For measurement of antagonist-inhibited increases in intracellular calcium, CHO-K1\ncells stably expressing human M1 receptors were plated in 96 or 384-well plates overnight at\n37degrees C and 5% CO2.  The next day, medium was removed and the cells were loaded with calcium\nindicator dye (2uM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C. Dye was removed and replaced with the\nappropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented\nwith 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X\nstock concentration (30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the\nassay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%. Acetylcholine EC20 and EC80 stocks were\nprepared at a 10x stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to the assay plates. Calcium\nmobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS 7000;\nHamamatsu) or a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following\nprotocol. Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition\nof the EC20 of acetylcholine followed 1 min later by the addition of an EC80 of acetylcholine. The\nsignal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the EC80 response.\nCompounds designated as 'Active' reduced the EC80 acetylcholine response to less than or equal to\n15% of the vehicle control sample, and thus were given a 'Score' of '100'. 'Inactive' compounds\ngave greater than 15% of the EC80 response when compared to the vehicle controls.\n" ;

When cells were agonized with a 5HT1E agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene\noccurred via the Ga15 protein-coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was\nproportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA\nsubstrate. \n\nIn this experiment 51 compounds were tested to determine individual EC50 values. The compounds were\n\"hit-picked\" at a 10 millimolar concentration in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at\nthree fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations. The highest test\nconcentration was nominally 43 micromolar.\n\nThe CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH.\nThe growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\ncontaining 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA\n(Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES\n(Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin\n(Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml\n(Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055).\nPrior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.4 million/milliliter in phenol red\nfree Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM\nL-Glutamine. \n\nThe HTS assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well\nplate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for negative\ncontrol wells) was added. The selective 5HT1E agonist, BRL-54443 was also added (43 nL) to positive\ncontrol wells to a final concentration of one micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in\n100% activity (EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. \nAfter the incubation, 2 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture\n(Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and\ncontaining 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added to all wells. After 1 hour of incubation\nat room temperature, plate fluorescence was measured with the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm\n& 460 nm.  The ratio of 460 nm/590 nm fluorescence emission was calculated for each well. \nPercent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression:\n%Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median\nratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)]\nFor each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition\nor where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\ninhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10\nmicromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are\nconsidered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS\ncan stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster\novary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected\nusing a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). This particular\nassay uses a high density of sampling across concentration-response space to establish more\nconfidence estimates of potency.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained\nfrom Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in\n1536-well format. For both agonist (1-220s) and antagonist (221-400s) phases, the maximums of\nkinetic fluorescence responses were converted separately into text files using the instrument's\nsoftware data export utility. Data for agonist response were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (NPS). Data for antagonist response were normalized to the\ncontrols for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\nNPS 1536-well FDSS assay protocol:\n(1) Frozen CHO-NPSR cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's\nmedia supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were\nplated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates,\nand then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours.\n(2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The\ncalcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction.\n(3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 to 120 min.\n(4) Load plates to FDSS-7000.

Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\n\n1.

Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a\ngiven trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in\nwhich antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the\nfluorescence value at the time point immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any\nsubtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes. Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers. However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs. This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands.\nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke.\nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways. This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal. Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\nCompounds were tested at 30uM (fixed) in the presence of a submaximal concentration of\nacetylcholine (ACh) (~EC10) and evaluated for their ability to elevate the response to ACh in rM1-\nor hM5-expressing CHO cells using the primary calcium assay.\nCompounds eliciting a response less than approximately 40 %ACh Max in either or both cell line were\nscored as inactive (0).  Compounds eliciting a response between approximately 40 and 60 %ACh Max in\neither or both cell lines were scored as partially active (50).  Compounds eliciting a response\ngreater than approximately 60 %ACh Max in either or both cell lines were considered fully active\n(100).\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Assay Rationale and Summary: Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped Gram-negative enterobacteria that\ncauses typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and foodborne illness. Salmonella enterica, serovar\nTyphimurium, is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis (acute intestinal inflammation), and is\nused as a mouse model of human typhoid fever. Serovar Typhi is the cause of the human disease\ntyphoid fever. Every year, approximately 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United\nStates. Because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections\nmay be thirty or more times greater. The most recent outbreak in the US occurred in April, 2008.\nYoung children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are the most likely to develop severe\ninfections. The rate of diagnosed infections in children less than five years old is about five\ntimes higher than the rate in all other persons. The incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is\nincreasing worldwide, causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each\nyear. S. typhi infections occur worldwide but primarily in developing nations where sanitary\nconditions are poor. Early antibiotic therapy has transformed a previously life-threatening illness\nof several weeks' duration with an overall mortality rate approaching 20% into a short-term febrile\nillness with negligible mortality. However, case fatality rates of 10-50% have been reported from\nendemic countries when diagnosis is delayed. Typhoid fevers are endemic in Asia, Africa, Latin\nAmerica, and the Caribbean, affects 13-17 million people yearly, and kills an estimated 600,000.\nThe PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in Salmonella that also controls the adaptation\nto Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables Salmonella to determine its presence in an\nintracellular or extracellular environment, and to promote the expression of genes required for\nsurvival within or entry into host cells, respectively. The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus\nindicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ. The gene\nproducts are members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to\nenvironmental stimuli, and regulate the expression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage\nsurvival of S. enterica. \nDuring the past year the assay provider's group has constructed and evaluated multiple\nPhoP-activated promoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of\ngene transcripts in wild-type serovar Typhi. They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as\nPhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing versus inducing conditions for\neach of the promoters. He has used these reporters in Salmonella serovar Typhi to create a\nhigh-throughput screening (HTS) assay for identifying compounds that specifically inhibit PhoP\ninduction. To this end, our team has developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the\ndiscovery of small molecule inhibitors of the PhoP virulence regulon of S. enterica which may lead\nto the identification of novel strategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial\ninfection. The proposed primary assays, counter screens, and secondary assays, which utilize\nquantitative, established techniques, will allow identification of hits, confirmation of target\nspecificity, and the prioritization of assay chemical probes. The primary screening GFP expression\nassay in Salmonella typhi was used to determine PhoP regulation by measuring expression of the\nGreen Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene fused to the promoter for PhoP. During bacterial growth,\nfluorescence was determined in PhoP inducing (low Mg2+, 10uM) conditions in the presence of test\ncompounds. Controls included (high Mg2+, 10mM) to simulate compounds that would repress PhoP.\nPrimary Assay Conditions:  The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. \nMedia for the S. typhi virK-GFP and nmpC-GFP consisted of 1X standard M9MM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)\nsupplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.0021% Tryptophan, 0.0037% Cysteine, 0.0016% Histidine, 0055%\nThymidine, 0.00169% Thiamine, 5uM FeSO4, and 20uM CaCl2.  Initially, 25nl of test compound (50uM\nfinal concentration) in 100% DMSO was added to the respective plate wells. Compounds were dispensed\nusing an Echo 550 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA). Culture and media volumes were\ndispensed using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).  Cultures were grown overnight\nin media containing 2mM MgCl2.  The next morning, 20 ml of the overnight culture was centrifuged,\nwashed in media without MgCl2, then inoculated into 150ml of media containing either 10uM MgCl2\n(for PhoP-GFP induction) or 10mM MgCl2 (for PhoP-GFP suppression), and grown to an OD of\napproximately 0.2.  The cultures were then dispensed into the plates (preplated with compounds,\nfinal compound concentration was 50uM) and incubated for 4h at 37C.  Final DMSO concentration was\n1%.  \nEndpoint addition and read:  After incubation, the plates were bottom-read for fluorescence\nintensity using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at\n480/535nm respectively.\nControls and Drug Addition: Controls included high/low Mg2+ (10mM/10uM) wells (media and DMSO\nblank).  No control drug was available for this assay, so high Mg2+ simulated compounds that would\nrepress the PhoP gene and reduce GFP expression.  25nl of compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed\ninto the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a\nfinal concentration of 50uM. DMSO concentration was maintained at 1% for all wells of each plate.\nData Analysis: 128 high Mg2+ wells and 128 low Mg2+ wells per plate were used to calculate Z' value\nfor each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. The overall Z Factor for the primary\nassay was 0.7.  Data were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base software. Results for each\nconcentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and was calculated as: 100*(Test\nCompound - Low Mg2+ Control)/(High Mg2+ Control - Low Mg2+ Control). The dose response data was\nanalyzed using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum and\nminimum locked at 100 and 0. From these curves IC50 values were calculated.    \n" ;

When cells were agonized with a 5HT1E agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene\noccurred via the Ga15 protein-coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was\nproportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA\nsubstrate. \nThe primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 6\nmicromolar final concentration.\nThe results of the potency assay will be published in a future submission.\n\nThe CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH.\nThe growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\ncontaining 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA\n(Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES\n(Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin\n(Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml\n(Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055).\nPrior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.25 million/milliliter in phenol red\nfree Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM\nL-Glutamine. \n\nThe HTS assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate and incubating for 20 hours.

The\ncompounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the following criteria: 1) they were\ndeclared active in AID 932; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments\nentitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation\" (PubChem\nAID 871).\nIn this assay activation of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell\nline that stably expresses a human STAT3-luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in\nSTAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase\nreporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to\nactivate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring\nwell luminescence. An activator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus enhancing the\nactivity of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well luminescence. As designed, test\ncompounds that increase STAT3 activity are considered non-selective activators.\n\nThe activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run\nsimultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin\nand streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel\ntherapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the\nintersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby\noffering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest,\nsince they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly\nactivate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nThe NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific\nmotifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce\nactivation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a\ngeneral bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria\n(S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M.\ntuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).\n Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in\ncells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing\nconvenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells.\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved\nin inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induction of\nhuman breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD2 combined with small doses of\ncycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release (da Silva Correia, 2006; da\nSilva Correia 2007).\nMDP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if the primary\nand confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD2-mediated NF-kB pathway. Nod2 is a general sensor of\npeptidoglycan through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive\npeptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria (Girardin,2003). Here we used MDP to promote IL-8\nsecretion in MCF-7 cells.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nluminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" (AID 1578) and followed\nup in \"SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" (AID 2072) to study the structure-activity\nrelationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial\nsources or synthesized internally.\n\nProtocol:  \n1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD2\n2. MDP-LD (Invivogen)\n3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)\n4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices)\nProtocol:\n1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added\ninto respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations.\n2. MDP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7\ncells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter).\n3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC\n(5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours.\n4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit\nfrom BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences)\nwere coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium\ncarbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer\n(PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room\ntemperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of\nstandards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes,\n100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then\nsealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the\nplate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and\nabsorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular\nDevices).

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases.\n\nRas and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.\nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted\npyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to\nbe crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas\nSpecialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications\nincluded functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the\n3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to\nthe fully unsaturated pyrazole.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

PRP was exposed to 1584 cherry\npicked compounds chosen based on activity of the primary screen and those with similar structure to\nprovide some SAR data.  Compounds were plated at dose, with final testing concentrations ranging\nfrom 11.25uM to 0.875um.  The positive control, Cilostazol (Sigma #C0737, Lot# 042K4704,\nBRD-K67017579-001-04-2) was included on all plates to give a final screening concentration of\n100uM.  Compounds were added to PRP for 30 minutes prior to addition of the thrombin receptor\n(Par1) activator SFLLRN (5uM, Bachem, H-8365) and detection reagent CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G755)\nusing a modified protocol, for measurement of ATP released from the dense granules. PBS is used in\nplace of CellTiter-Glo Buffer thus preventing platelet lysis and a high background of ATP.\nLuminescence measurements are taken 15 minutes after reagent addition.  The 1584 compounds were\ntested on two donor samples of PRP.\nExpected Outcome: A decrease in the luminescent signal will identify compounds that either inhibit\nthe release of dense granules from the platelets, or inhibit the luciferase enzyme. Compounds that\nretest positively will be those that show inhibition of signal in a dose-dependent manner in at\nleast one of the donor PRP samples.  Normalization and curve fitting of the retest data was\nperformed using the Genedata Screener applications. Specificity for the inhibition of platelet\ndense granule release will be determined in secondary assay testing for inhibition of luciferase.\nTaken from 2016-01-A01-012\n1) Plasma bag(s) from a single donor were emptied into a sterile bottle (250 or 500ml, depending on\nvolume of plasma) in a hood. If multiple bags exist from a single donor (matching barcodes), they\nwere combined as to increase batch volume. Multiple donors' samples could not be pooled due to\npossible immunological reactions, therefore multiple batches were run daily with each being\nprepared singly. All information provided on each unit used was recorded (source, donor number,\nblood type, etc.).\n2) Samples were taken to count the number of platelets/ml and checked for activation activity by\naddition of SFLLRN and CellTiter-Glo.\n3) The Thermo MultiDrop Combi in a hood was prepared for dispensing 20ul of plasma per well. As\nmany plates allowable with volume of plasma were filled from a single donor. Batch size ranged from\n200ml-700ml. While filling, platelets were kept in homogeneous suspension by gentle agitation.\n4) Assay plates were loaded into racks for placement into a Liconic STR240 HRIT incubator set at\n30'C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. The incubator is docked to the screening system. Compound plates have\ntheir foil seals pierced off-line. Those plates are loaded into a Liconic STR240 DRIT incubator set\nto 22'C, 15% humidity.\n5) CellTiter-Glo/SFLLRN was prepared for each day to a volume to accommodate the number of assay\nplates estimated for the day.

This assay also serves as\na counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based cell-based primary\nhigh throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1)\"\n(AID 588814).\nThis assay uses ATP as the agonist.

As\ndesigned, a compound that non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will\nlead to increased fluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence.\nCompounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity\n(RH).

Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately\nperformed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nThe percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%_Activation = ( (Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck\ncounterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation\nof test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: Cell-based\nhigh-throughput screening assay to identify potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y1\" (PubChem AID 1304) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of\nNPY-Y1\" (PubChem AID 1546), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell\nline transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure\npotentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells\nare treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic\nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC\nactivity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As\ndesigned, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity,\nleading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading\nto reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration\nof 3.6 uM.\n\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).

Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the\nplates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence\nmeasurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM\nfinal concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 micromolar final nominal\nconcentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells.\nThe plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1\nmicroliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration)\nand the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The\nplates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol.\nAny compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Y2\nPotentiator Primary Screen was declared active.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel\ntherapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the\nintersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby\noffering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest,\nsince they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly\nactivate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nThe NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific\nmotifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce\nactivation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a\ngeneral bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria\n(S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M.\ntuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).\n Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in\ncells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing\nconvenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells.\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved\nin inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human\nbreast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of\ncycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release (da Silva Correia, 2006; da\nSilva Correia 2007).\nGamma-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if\nthe primary and confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD1-mediated NF-kB pathway. NOD1\nspecifically detects Gamma-Tri-DAP, a tripeptide motif found in Gram-negative bacterial\npeptidoglycan, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kB pathway. Here we used\nGM-Tri-DAP to induce IL-8 secretion in MCF-7 cells. (Girardin,2003).\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nluminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" (AID 1578) and followed\nup in \"SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" )AID 2333) to study the structure-activity\nrelationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial\nsources or synthesized internally.\n\n1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1\n2. GM-Tri-DAP (Sigma)\n3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)\n4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices)\nProtocol:\n1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added\ninto respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations.\n2. GM-Tri-DAP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of\nMCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter).\n3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC\n(5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours.\n4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit\nfrom BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences)\nwere coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium\ncarbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer\n(PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room\ntemperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of\nstandards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes,\n100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then\nsealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the\nplate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and\nabsorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular\nDevices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed.\n5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve\nanalysis.\n" ;

In this assay, a ssDNA oligonucleotide molecular beacon substrate, featuring a 5'\nfluorescent Cy5 moiety and a 3' quencher, is annealed to a second longer DNA oligonucleotide. Upon\nstrand separation by NS3 helicase and ATP, the beacon strand forms an intramolecular hairpin that\nbrings the tethered fluorophore and quencher molecules into juxtaposition, quenching fluorescence.\nAs designed, compounds that inhibit helicase activity at 60 minutes (T60) will prevent hairpin\nformation and interaction of the Cy5 fluorophore and quencher, thus preventing quenching of well\nfluorescence. A T0 fluorescence measurement is also performed to identify compounds that quench and\nenhance Cy5 fluorescence.

A moderate decrease in the amount of\nP-selectin expressed on the surface of platelets in a dose-dependent manner will identify compounds\nthat inhibit pathways that regulate granule secretion or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)\nexpressed on the surface of platelets.  Lack of substantial inhibition of surface expression of\nP-selectin is indicative of compounds that might selectively effect dense granule secretion. \nAdditional secondary testing will further delineate the specificity of the probes.\nPrimary Collaborators(and laboratory where this assay was performed):\n\n1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were tested at different concentrations of compound (100uM, 30uM, 1uM,\n0.3uM, and 0uM for cherry-picks and 30uM, 10uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for powders).\n2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 uM\nthrombin-receptor-derived hexapeptide SFLLRN from 100 uM stock.\n3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD\nBiosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently.\n4. After a 20-minute incubation, 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the\nsamples.\n5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface\nof the platelets as a response to activation.\n6. Geometric mean fluorescence values were collected for each sample.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified\nas active in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening\nassay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (PubChem AID 920), and that confirmed activity in a set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1\ninhibition\" (AID 1263), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of STAT3. The compounds\nselected for testing in this assay met the following criteria: 1) they were active in AID 920 and\nAID 1263; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high\nthroughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition\" (AID 862); 3) they were inactive in a set\nof experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput\nassay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition\" (AID 1303); and 4) they were inactive in a set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT1 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay\nto measure STAT3 inhibition\" (AID 1310).\nIn this assay STAT3 inhibition was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably\nexpresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct.  This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test\ncompounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase\nreporter activity.  Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to\nactivate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring\nluminescence. As designed, a STAT3 inhibitor will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus\npreventing or reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to decreased well\nluminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting\nat a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM.\n\nThe inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run\nsimultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin\nand streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and\n95% relative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 microliters of\ncell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay\nwas started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, nifuroxazide (112 micromolar\nfinal nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final\nconcentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C\n(5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final EC80 concentration)\nwas dispensed into all wells. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95%\nRH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at\nroom temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well\nluminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader." ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in previous\nexperiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y2,\" (PubChem AID 1359), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (PubChem AID\n1304) were nonselective. In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a\ncyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of\nisoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific\nbeta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is\nmeasured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP\nproduction or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence,\nthus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin,\nstreptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul\nvolume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black\nclear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours\nat 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x\nconcentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature\nfor 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm\nexcitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of 0.1%\nBSA was dispensed to all wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4% final\nconcentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at\nroom temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its\nEC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM\nfinal concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at\nroom temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using:\n% Inhibition = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of a DMSO assay plate of wells containing DMSO and\nisoproterenol, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two\nvalues was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than\nthe cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition\nvalue. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 23 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 24 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nParental HEK293-CNG Cell Line (supplied by Assay Provider)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked\nalpha-D-glucose residues, which releases alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is\nrequired for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in humans.\nDeficiency of this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as\nPompe disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in the\nlysosomes and cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen\nstorage within lysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular\ninjury. In turn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg:\ncardiomyopathy and muscle weakness).\nIt has been reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from\ngenetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. 1-deoxynojirimycin, an\ninhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit pharmacological chaperone activity, which\nsignificantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this alpha-glucosidase\nassay in 1536-well plate format for identification of novel small molecule inhibitors or activators\nwith structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop new pharmacological chaperones.\nPrevious assays of alpha-Glucosidase have utilized a non-natural fluorescent substrate to probe\nenzyme activity. The present assay measures enzyme activity on glycogen using a coupled-assay\nsystem to glucose oxidase.\n\nThis is an enzyme assay using glycogen from bovine liver (Sigma catalog #: G0885) as the substrate\nand recombinant human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon hydrolysis of the\nsubstrate, the glucose product can be detected using the Amplex Red Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit\n(Invitrogen catalog #: A22189). The product of this reaction can be read with a fluorescence plate\nreader with an excitation at 573 nm and an emission at 610 nm. Data were normalized to the controls\nfor basal activity (without enzyme) and 100% activity (with enzyme). The AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\nAssay buffer for enzyme reaction: 50 mM citric acid (titrated with potassium phosphate to pH 5.0),\n0.01% Tween-20 (pH 5.0 is an optimal condition for this enzyme assay)\nAssay buffer for Amplex Red reaction: Tris-HCl, pH 7.5\n1536-well assay protocol for the alpha-glucosidase assay:\n(1) Add 2 ul/well alpha-glucosidase enzyme solution (4 nM final)\n(2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism\nafter an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293\nTrex D2 cell line.\nFreshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000\ncells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight\nincubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD\nBioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1\nsecond/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of\ncompound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically\nat 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds.  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC80 (negative\nmodulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head.

This receptor signals through\nphospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production.\nCryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of\nreceptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1\nantibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the\nantibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates\nendogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to\nthe labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1\nantagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1\navailable to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the\nlabeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in triplicate in\na 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 66.2 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media\nconsisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified\nfetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 350 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin,\nstreptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well\nmicrotiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO and antagonist controls in DMSO were added\nto the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL\nof Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC80 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the\nappropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1\n(prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and\ncentrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis\nbuffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds\nand plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After\nexcitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm\nbandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate\nreader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I671nm / I618nm\nWhere:\nI671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm.\nI618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 66.2 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 66.2 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-85, and for inactive compounds 84-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO/OX1R cells (supplied by Assay Provider)\nIP-One Tb Kit (Cisbio, part 62IPAPEJ)\nHam's F-12 media (Invitrogen, part 11765-054)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, part 159910)\nAgonist: Orexin A peptide (Tocris, part 1455)\nAntagonist: SB-334867-A (Tocris, part 1960)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\nTo measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Assay Overview:\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds synthesized to explore\nstructure activity relationship of SID 14723044. This compound was identified as active in a\nprevious set of experiments entitled, \"Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to\nmeasure p97 ATPase inhibition\" (PubChem AID 1481), and confirmed activity in a subsequent set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Confirmation biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of\nthe p97 ATPase\" (PubChem AID 1517). This biochemical assay employs the Kinase-Glo reagent, which\ncontains a luciferase that emits luminescence in direct proportion to ATP levels. As designed,\ncompounds that inhibit the ATPase activity of p97 will reduce ATP hydrolysis, thereby increasing\nthe relative levels of ATP available for consumption by luciferase, resulting in increased well\nluminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting\nat a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay, 18 ul of Assay Buffer (1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM\nEDTA, pH 8.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2, rows O and P of\n384-well assay plates. The remaining wells were filled with 18 ul of Assay Buffer supplemented with\n0.42 uM p97 protein. Next, 50 nL of test compounds in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration)\nwere added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 25 degrees\nCelsius. The assay was started by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mM Tris supplemented with 100 uM ATP\nto all wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 25 degrees Celsius. After incubation, 20\nul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all wells and the plates were incubated for another 10\nminutes at 25 degrees Celsius. Plates were centrifuged and well luminescence was measured by the\nEnvision microplate reader.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay\n\nThe Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase\nsignaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell\nsurface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by\nthe small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs.\nAlternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for\nhigh-throughput screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays\nconsisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of\ntarget for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The\ncompounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR\nmutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of\nthe prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other\nimportant ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1.\n\nThe HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR\nmutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled\nstreptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the\nsubstrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in\nhomogenous assay format.\nEGFR and EGFR\nmutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM\nMgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate.\nThe HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme\nwas preformed in 384 well format (data not included).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to\nidentify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1).\n\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1510), and that confirmed activity in a set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Confirmation Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1524), were nonselective antagonists due to inhibition\nof S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the\nGPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4\nmigrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic,\ncell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit\nS1P1 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and\nBLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a\nfinal nominal concentration of 5 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4\nmicroliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO\nalone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the\nappropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the\nincubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nInhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two\nvalues were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound\nwells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a\ncutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that\nparticular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition\nvalue. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 24 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 24 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG-1-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy#s 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary\ngland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin\nsignaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through\nregulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis.\nSignificantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung\nfibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human\nrelaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive\nheart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic\nsclerosis.\nUpon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs.\ncAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP\nincrease is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists\nof the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1\nactivation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence\nenergy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit.\n\nThis is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP1\nreceptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were\nlysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell\nlysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to\na decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer\nonly) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to test a set of synthesized compounds for S1P4 agonist activity. This\nassay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6\n(EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also\nexpress a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under\nthe control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration\nof the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor.\nThe liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene.\nBLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a\ncleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4\nagonists will activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth\nmedia consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM\nNEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200\nug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, 100 ug/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The\nnext day, 50 nL of test compound (50 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample\nwells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control\nprepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final\nconcentration of 6 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the\nincubation, 22 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nSelected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to\nnormalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels (ie,\nfluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay\ndata, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm / I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. The reported\nEC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50%\ninhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50\nuM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than\n50 uM.\nPubChem Activity Score and Outcome:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAll active compounds were ranked by potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest\nactivity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-76, and for inactive compounds 60-0.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive\nimpairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until\nrecently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1\nselective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which\nprohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1\nPAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all\nallosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse\nchemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS.\nAssay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M3 were loaded with calcium indicator dye\n(2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X\nHBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All\ncompounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This\nstock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. \nAcetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay\nbuffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a\nFLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were\npreincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist,\nacetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca.\nEC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the\nmaximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad\nPrism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope).  Compound\ndose-response curves with R2 > 0.5 were assigned as 'Active.' The 'Score' was assigned as '100' for\ncompounds with EC50 < 1uM and as '50' for compounds with EC50 > 1uM. All other compounds were\nassigned as 'Inactive' with a 'Score' of '0'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions .\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

ATP generation was detected in a coupled reaction by\nluciferase-mediated luminescence, an ATP-dependent process.  Pyruvate kinase substrates, PEP and\nADP, were present in the assay at Km and approximately 10-fold below Km respectively. The enzyme\nwas assayed at an intermediate level of activity to screen for both inhibitors and activators.  \n\nThree uL of substrate mix (at r.t.) in assay buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2,\n0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid bottom 1,536 well microtiter plates so\nthat the final concentrations of substrates in the assay were 0.1 mM ADP and 0.5 mM PEP.  23 nL of\ncompound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix in assay buffer (4 degree Celsius) was\nadded.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. \nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. \nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\nCHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM)\nfor 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS\n(Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All\ncompounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was\nthen added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was\nprepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium\nmobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)\naccording to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for\n1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec\nwith a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and\nthen as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were\ndetermined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression\n(variable slope).\nFor compounds with an average EC50  equal to or greater than 10uM, 'Outcome' was assigned as\n'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '0'. For compounds with an average EC50 less than 10uM,\n'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. The 'Score' for compounds with average EC50s greater than or\nequal to 10uM was assigned as '50' and for less than 1uM as '100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is\na luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from\nDiscoveRx.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nidentification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and\nreversibly activates the receptor. An antagonist or inhibitor receptor activation would provide a\nnovel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease\npathology.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor\nresulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.\nThis assay is a follow-up to \"uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the APJ \nreceptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 2521.\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Memories persist for different lengths of time, from seconds or minutes to a lifetime. There are\ntwo kinds of memory: short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). STM lasts for minutes to\nhours, which maybe mediated by modifications of molecules involved in synaptic functions. LTM lasts\nfor days or longer, and may be due to the formation of new synapses or restructuring of existing\nsynapses. LTM, but not STM, requires gene transcription and synthesis of proteins. CREB (cyclic-AMP\nResponsive Element Binding Protein) is one of the candidates plays an important role for\nenhancement of some types of LTM. CREB, a family of transcription factors, regulates the\ntranscription of genes containing cAMP Responsive Elements (CRE). CRE is a nucleotide sequence\noften found in the promoter regions of genes that are binding sites for CREB. \nUsing a beta-lactamase reporter-gene under control of cAMP responsive element, a cell-based assay\n[CellSensor(TM) CRE-bla CHO developed by Invitrogen Corp.] was used to measure forskolin-induced\nsignaling.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen for agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput dose\nresponse assay for agonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding\nbehavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation.\nImportantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY\nmediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors\n(GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have\nimplicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2),\nanxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling\n(6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and\ntumorigenesis (10). Due to the varied role of these receptors in human disease and physiology, the\nidentification of high affinity selective probes that target each receptor subtype may provide\nnovel tools for the study of NPY-related pathologies.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of\nprevious experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators\nor agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1304), \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of\nNPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1697),\nand inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2,\" (AID\n1359) and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (AID 1704) were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2.\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure direct agonism of the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y2 will increase Y2\nactivity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence,\nthus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 3.6 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed\ninto each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the\nplates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence\nmeasurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices), and then 2 microliters of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to\nthe appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO\nalone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room\ntemperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its\nEC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS\n(25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room\ntemperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n- MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells\ncontaining only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these\ntwo values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation\nthan the cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation\nvalue. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-77, for inactive 58-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 3448770)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS\ncan stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster\novary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected\nusing a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). To validate the\nspecific action of compounds on the NPS receptor, a counterscreen was developed that tests\ncompounds' antagonism of M1 muscarinic receptor stimulation by carbachol. The protein, gene and\ntaxonomy linked to this assay refer to Rattus norvegicus, but Chinese Hamster ovary cells were\nactually used.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor\n(CHO-M1) was obtained from ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in\n1536-well format. The maximums of kinetic fluorescence responses were converted into text files\nusing the instrument's software data export utility. Data for antagonist response were normalized\nto the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (). AC50 values were determined\nfrom concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. \nCHO-M1 1536-well FDSS assay protocol:\n(1) Frozen CHO-M1 cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's\nmedia supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were\nplated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates,\nand then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours.\n(2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The\ncalcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. \n(3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 min.\n(4) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between\n0.6 nM and 46 uM. \n(5) Load plates to FDSS-7000. The following steps were performed on FDSS-7000.\n(6) Record fluorescent background (Ex 480 nm, Em 520-560 nm) for 10 s. \n(7) Add 2 ul of stimulation reagent (1X HBSS buffer, 0.1% BSA, 60 nM carbachol).

        bat:hasParagraph  "The 14-3-3 proteins are the prototype for a novel class of protein modules that can recognize\nphosphoserine/threonine (pS/T)-containing motifs in a variety of signaling proteins. To date,\n14-3-3 proteins have been reported to bind more than 200 client proteins. Through these\ninteractions, 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in a wide range of vital regulatory processes,\nsuch as Bad-induced apoptosis, Raf-1-mediated cell proliferation, and Cdc25-regulated cell cycle\nprogression. In addition to their participation in diverse physiological processes, 14-3-3 proteins\nhave been implicated in a number of clinically important pathological conditions, such as\nneurodegenerative disorders and cancers. Thus, such studies on the 14-3-3/client-protein\ninteractions may provide tremendous opportunities for therapeutic interventions.  Therefore,\nchemical tools would allow pharmacological probing of 14-3-3 function under various conditions.\nTo develop small-molecule modulators of 14-3-3 proteins, a highly sensitive fluorescence\npolarization (FP)-based 14-3-3 assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction of\n14-3-3 with a fluorescently labeled phosphopeptide from Raf-1 was used as a model system.  A simple\n1-step \"mix-and-measure\" method was achieved for analyzing 14-3-3 proteins. This is a\nsolution-based, versatile method that can be used to monitor the binding of 14-3-3 with a variety\nof client proteins. The 14-3-3 FP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a\n384-well format with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z' factor of above 0.7.\nBecause of its simplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for high-throughput screening of\n14-3-3 modulators.\n\nThe recombinant hexaHis-tagged 14-3-3gamma were expressed and purified as previously described. \nThe peptide sequence containing phosphorylated S259 of Raf-1 was synthesized\nand labeled with 5/6 carboxytetramethylrhodamine. HEPES buffer (10mM, pH 7.4), NaCl (150mM),\nTween-20 (0.05%), and DTT (0.5 mM) was used through the screening.\nThe 14-3-3 FP assay was carried out in black 384-well uplates in a total volume of 50uL in each\nwell. 49uL of assay reaction buffer (1uM of His-14-3-3gamma and 2nM of TMR-pS259-Raf peptide in\nHEPES buffer) were dispensed to 384-well black plate. For each assay plate, column 1, 2 and 23, 24\ncontain controls: TMRpS259-Raf peptide only (blank) and TMR-pS259-Raf peptide with His-14-3-3gamma\n(negative control); R18 peptide was added to wells with TMR-pS259-Raf peptide and His-14-3-3gamma\nand serve as positive control. Then 1ul of test compound (2 mM in DMSO) were added and the final\ncompound concentration is 40uM (2% DMSO). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hr and\nthe fluorescence polarization value in millipolarization (mP) units was measured with an Analyst HT\nreader. An excitation filter at 545nm and an emission filter at 610 to 675nm were used with a\ndichroic mirror of 565 nm. Assay data was analyzed using Cambridgesoft. Percentage of inhibition\nwas calculated by dividing mP (subtracting blank) value from compound wells by the average mP\n(subtracting blank) from negative controls (His-14-3-3gamma and peptide) in each plate and\nsubtracted from 100.

        bat:hasParagraph  "In most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic\ntranscription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied\nRNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific\nregulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard\ngenetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality. This\nscreen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins\nrequired for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First,\ninhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding\nproteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function\nacross nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent\nthat specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.\n \nThe two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class\ntandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the\ngermline from the soma. MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates\nposterior patterning and germline specification. Both proteins can be expressed and purified from\nEscherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to\nspecific RNA sequences in vitro. Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively\nmonitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate\nreader.\n \nExpected Outcome: The ability of purified POS-1 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently\nlabeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to\nscreen for inhibitors of this interaction.  Compounds inhibiting the interaction with show a\ndose-dependent reduction in the polarization value (in mP.)  This is a counterscreen because\ncompounds that inhibit the interaction of POS-1 protein with Mex-3 RNA in addition to the desired\nMEX-5-tcr2 disruption are not of interest for further development, as they are likely non-specific\ninhibitors of zinc finger protein-RNA binding or general protein disruptors such as detergents.\n \n7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844)\nin duplicate assay plates.  Predispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to\ntwo weeks.  For higher doses, 15 or 30 nL was predispensed.\nPOS-1 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was\nprepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master\nmix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004%\nIPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser\n(Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.  \nThe target binding sequence is a 3'-UTR fragment, mex3.  Fluorescent mex3 RNA\n(5'-AACUAUUAUUAUUUGUUAUUCAUAUUUU-FITC-3', IDT) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer and supplemented\nwith 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma).

The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to loading\nonto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature.\n1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr).\nThe assay plates with predispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on\nthe Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nThe plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either\n1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well\nof competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells).\nThe final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were:\n20 mM tris pH 8.0\n40 mM NaCl\n0.004% IPEGAL\n100 uM zinc acetate\n120 nM POS1 protein\n2 nM FITC labeled mex3 RNA\n4 ug/mL tRNA type X\n10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO\nFor positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled mex3 RNA\nPlates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute.\nOne hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a\nViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer) with a G factor of 1.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms from\narchaebacteria to humans, suggesting an essential role in cell survival (1, 2). Under circumstances\nof transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can\nrestore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when\npolyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated\nexpression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity\nphenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's\ndisease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin,\ntau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in\nthe appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to\nthe proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of\nalternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates.\nA role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with\nmammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that\nthe heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting\na role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4). Moreover, a direct\nrelationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock\nproteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues\nof affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5). Finally, overexpression of\nHsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8). High\nthroughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat\nshock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and\nmay lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders.\n \nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds \nidentified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based\nhigh-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70\n(Hsp70)\" (PubChem AID 1203). In this assay induction of the heat shock response by test compound is\nmeasured in a HeLa cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter under control of the human\nHsp70 promoter.  As designed, a compound that activates the Hsp70 promoter will increase luciferase\ntranscription, and thus increase well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe hsp70.1pr-luc HeLa cell line was routinely cultured in tissue culture flasks in growth media\n(Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1%\npen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture and 1% Geneticin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2\nand 95% relative humidity (RH).  \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended in growth media at a concentration of\n750,000 cells/mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates\n(3,750 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay\nwas started by dispensing 50 nL of test compound in DMSO to sample wells, DMSO alone (1% final\nconcentration) to negative control wells, or MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set\nas 100% activation) to positive control wells.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Memories persist for different lengths of time, from seconds or minutes to a lifetime. There are\ntwo kinds of memory: short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). STM lasts for minutes to\nhours, which maybe mediated by modifications of molecules involved in synaptic functions. LTM lasts\nfor days or longer, and may be due to the formation of new synapses or restructuring of existing\nsynapses. LTM, but not STM, requires gene transcription and synthesis of proteins. CREB (cyclic-AMP\nResponsive Element Binding Protein) is one of the candidates plays an important role for\nenhancement of some types of LTM. CREB, a family of transcription factors, regulates the\ntranscription of genes containing cAMP Responsive Elements (CRE). CRE is a nucleotide sequence\noften found in the promoter regions of genes that are binding sites for CREB. \nUsing a luciferase reporter-gene under control of cAMP responsive element, a cell-based assay\n[CRE-luc2P HEK293 developed by Promega] was used to measure forskolin-induced signaling. The\nselected compounds were measured for their ability to modulate positively the action of EC10 NKH\n477, a water soluble forskolin, on reporter gene activity. Compounds were screened in a titration\nseries in 1536-well format. Positive modulators were identified based on the AC50 values derived\nfrom the screening data. \n\n2500 cells/5uL in DEME with 1% FBS was dispensed into 1536-well plates and cells were cultured at\n37 degrees Celsius overnight. Next day 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using\na pin tool, and 1uL of EC10 level of NKH 477, or EC100 level of IBMX, a PDE inhibitor, in the\npresent of NKH 477, or assay medium was added. And then the plates were incubated at 37 degrees\nCelsius for 4 hours. 6 uL of Bright-Glo luciferase (Promega, WI) was added to each well. After\nincubated at room temperature for 10min the plates were measured for luminescence intensity on a\nViewLux (Perkin Elmer) detector. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors\ntransduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of\ninflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2).  STATs are activated in\nresponse to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases\n(1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are\nphosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear\ntranslocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although\nstructurally similar, the seven STAT family member (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess\ndiverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and\nanti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is\nlargely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved\nin IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus\nSTAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Studies show that STAT3 is activated\nin a majority of breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a\ndominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1, 4, 6). \nBlocking STAT3 interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using peptide aptamers\nhas been shown to reduce tumor growth (7).  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes\nassociated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective modulators of STAT1 and STAT3\nactivity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as\nactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening\nassay to measure STAT3 inhibition\" (PubChem AID 862). The compounds selected for testing in this\nAID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862; 2) they were\ndeclared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput\nscreening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (PubChem AID 920).\nIn this assay inhibition of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell\nline that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in\nSTAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated\nSTAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment\nwith IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by\nmeasuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 antagonist will block IL-6-mediated STAT3\ntranscription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and\ndecreasing well luminescence.\n\nThe STAT3 antagonist and potentiator confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  U3A cells were\ngrown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal\nbovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100\nmicrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell\nsuspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The assay was\nstarted by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in\nDMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (100 uM final nominal\nconcentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final\nconcentration; set as 0% inhibition).  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C\n(5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final concentration) was\ndispensed into sample and all control wells.  This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80%\nSTAT3::luciferase reporter activity.  Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5%\nCO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at\nroom temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. \nLuminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.  \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dose response counterscreen assay for neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high\nthroughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of\nneuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1),\" (PubChem AID 1040).  The compounds selected for testing in\nthis AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 1040;  2) they confirmed\nactivity in a set of experiments entitled, \"Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for\nantagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)\" (AID 1254); and 3) they were declared inactive\nin a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor\nY1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism\" (AID 1255). \nA cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were\nused to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\nTo measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series\nstarting at a nominal test concentration of 35 uM.\n\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nPrior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth\nmedia as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue\nculture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated\nprobe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. \nFollowing incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and\n565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by\ndispensing 2 microliters of NPY at its EC95 (8 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL\nof either test compound, High Control (BIIE0246, 0.28 micromolar final nominal concentration) or\nLow Control (DMSO, 0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells.  The plates were\nthen incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution\ncontaining isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase\ninhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  The plates were then incubated\nfor 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same\ninstrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: \nRatio = (T45 / T0)\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))]*100\nWhere: \nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and challenge\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and challenge \nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing BIIE0246 and challenge. \nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. \nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50\nequal to or less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344870)\n10x ACTOne membrane potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nDulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 14190-144)\nDMEM high glucose with glutamine (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American peptide, part 60-1-11B)\nBIIE0246 (Tocris, part 1700)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

When the 5-HT1a receptor is agonized,\ntranscription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurs via a Ga15 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount\nof BLA activity is proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a\nfluorescent BLA substrate.\n\nThe CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH.\nThe growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\ncontaining 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone SH30079.03), 0.1 mM NEAA\n(Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES\n(Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 1000 ug/mL Geneticin\n(Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 5 ug/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen, part R210-01) , Zeocin 100ug/ml\n(Invitrogen, part R-250-01) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Invitrogen, part 15640-055).\nPrior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 0.4 million/milliliter in phenol red\nfree Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM\nL-Glutamine. .\n\nThe assay began by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well\nplate and incubating for 20 hours. Then 43 nL of either test compound or DMSO control (for positive\ncontrol wells) was added. The selective 5HT1A agonist, 5-CT was also added to negative control and\ntest compound wells to a final concentration of 70 nanomolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in\n80% of maximal activity.

The ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was then calculated for each well.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/(median_negative_control -\nmedian_positive_control)))*100\nThe positive control wells were analogous to wells treated with just media (basal activity) and the\nnegative controls wells were treated with the EC80 of 5-CT.\nFor each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (43 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition\nor where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\ninhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10\nmicromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are\nconsidered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved.

This assay determines OXTR (OTR)\nagonism dose response curves.\nIn this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell\npermeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye\nserves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that\nact as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative\nfluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in\ntriplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 29.9\nuM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH).

Next, 2 uL of\nthe fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated\nfor 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature.\nThen, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone\nwere dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate\nfluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the\nremaining 95 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_ Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive.

Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-100, and for inactive compounds 100-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO-OTR cells (provided by Assay provider)\nOxytocin (Sigma-Aldrich, part 06379)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (AAT Bioquest, part 2456)\nF-12 (Ham) (Invitrogen, part 11765)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, part 159910)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Disease: Spinal Muscular Atrophy\nRationale: Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a pediatric genetic disease that results from homozygous\ndeletion of the SMN1 gene. Patients have a second gene, SMN2, that is closely related in sequence\nto SMN1 and encodes the same SMN protein. However, the SMN2 gene is alternatively spliced,\nproducing 30% of the full length mRNA and 70% of am mRNA species that excludes exon 7. Compounds\nthat increase the frequency with which exon 7 is included into the SMN2 mRNA cause a concomitant\nincrease in the level of SMN protein and are of therapeutic value to SMA patients. We developed a\n384-well-based high-throughput screen for compounds that correct this splicing defect in the SMN2\ngene without affecting splicing of the SMN1 gene.\nSignal Type: bigger is better\nCell Lines: C33A human cervical carcinoma cells (ATCC# HTB-31) were stably transfected with an SMN\nfragment/luciferase reporter gene construct that incorporates exons 6-8 of SMN1 or SMN2.

The assay reagent consists of: 25mM\nglycylglycine, 15mM magnesium sulfate, 4mM EGTA, adjusted to a pH of 7.85, to which was added 10 M\nD-luciferin (Sigma L 9504), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Roche Molecular Biochemicals 100034), 2 mM\nadenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP, Sigma A7699), 50 M Coenzyme A, sodium salt (Sigma C 3144) and 1.5%\nTriton X-100.\nScreen: incubation of cells with test compoundsFor the luciferase assay, cells were removed from\nT-175 culture flasks with 3 mL trypsin, quenched with 7 ml assay medium. The cells (~35-40M\ncells/flask) were spun down and re-suspended in assay medium to a concentration of ~200,000\ncells/ml. The cells were immediately seeded with a Zymark SciClone ALH in 384-well assay plates\n(Nalge Nunc white plates, #164610) 57 L/well for a cell density of 11,000 cells/well. Compounds\nfrom the NINDS library were added to reach a final concentration of 10 M (diluted with assay medium\nby 1000x from the 10 mM stock solution in DMSO). The cells were incubated with the test compounds\nat 37 degrees C for ~48 hours. A Zymark Sciclone ALH was used for both cell seeding and compound\naddition. After incubation, the assay plates were cooled to room temperature for ~10-60 minutes.\nThe medium and compounds were aspirated from the wells, followed by 6 rinse/aspirate cycles with a\nPBS solution. 53 L of the luciferase assay reagent was added and the plate was immediately\ntransferred to a luminescence plate reader. The plate was shaken for 30 seconds prior to reading.\nThe plate processing steps were performed on an integrated Packard Minitrak/Sidetrak.\nData Analysis: The dark count background was first subtracted from all luminescence readings. The\nsignal from each compound-treated well was divided the average of 48 control wells on the same\n384-well plate. Each compound library plate was tested in triplicate with each of the two cell\nlines and the entire assay was repeated on two separate occasions, yielding six readings for each\ncompound for each cell line. The highest and lowest of the six normalized readings were dropped and\nthe remaining four readings averaged. These average values of compound-treated luminescence versus\ncontrol luminescence are denoted Xnorm(y) where X indicates the cell line, SMN1 or SMN2, and y is\nthe compound. The difference of SMN2norm (y)-SMN1norm (y) measures the selective change in SMN2\nluciferase expression versus change in SMN1 luciferase production upon treatment with compound y.\nThe is the final score that is output.\nDilution Series: 48 compounds were selected for retesting in a two-fold, 20-point dilution series\nwith a maximum concentration of 10 M. These dilutions were created with a Zymark Sciclone ALH Z-8.\nOnce created, the assay was performed as described in the screening section. Concentrations\nrequired to achieve 50% of the maximally achievable effect for each compound (EC50) were calculated\nusing Xlfit (IDBS).\nDetection Reagent: D-luciferin\nAssay Type: mammalian cell-based\nNumber Replicates: 6\nAssay Readout: luminescence\nDetection Instrument: Packard Fusion platereader\nLiquid Handling Robot: Packard Minitrak\nLiquid Handling Robot: Packard Sidetrak\nLiquid Handling Robot: Zymark Sciclone ALH\nConcentration Primary Screen (M): 10\nNumber Negative Controls: 368\nNegative Control Mean: 9803.0\nNegative Control Standard Deviation: 1160.0\nNumber Positive Controls: 368\nPositive Control Mean: 42936.0\nPositive Control Standard Deviation: 5269.0\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing\nalpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers). Compounds that cause a reduction in\nluciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity. Assays were\nconducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of 3.75 mM compound was added to the\ncell solutions (7.5 uM final [compound]). The positive control used in this assay was\nstrophanthidine (Sigma, Cat.# S6626-250MG, Lot#038K1036), which was used in dose (12-point, 2-fold\ndilution, from 20 uM final [compound]) and was incorporated at the beginning and end of each days\nrun. Cells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature and 30 uL Steady-Glo (Promega,\nE2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and\nluciferase levels were measured.\nTaken from 2023-01-A02-03 through 2023-01-A02-07\n1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-Luciferase gene\nfusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza,\n12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM\nPenstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD\nFalcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h).\n2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro,\n25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95%\nhumidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This\n10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3\nmin at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was\nresuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below).\n3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally\nused 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency.\n4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media\npre-warmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles.\n5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well\nin 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a\nsterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood.\n6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX\n2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight.\n7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in\nCBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes\nBiosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system.\nReplicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL 3.75 uM compound (final\nconcentration = 7.5 uM) each with a 100 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions).\n8) Plates with compound were then re-lidded and returned to the Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) and\nincubated for 48 h at 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2.\n9) Plates were then individually moved to a room temperature Liconic Carousel (LPX 220) and were\nallowed to temperature equilibrate for 30 min.\n10) Plates were then delidded and moved to a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser where 30 uL of 0.5X\nSteady-Glo (Promega, E2250, lot 273368) was added (Steady-Glo maintained at 4 C and warmed to room\ntemperature using a Combi cassette with a 6 ft input line submerged in a room temperature water\nbath).\n11) Plates were then relidded and returned to the Liconic Carousel and incubated at room\ntemperature for 30 min.\n12) Plates were then delidded and moved to an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and Luminescence\nvalues were collected using with 100 ms read time per well.\n13) Plates were then relidded and discarded.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by disabling motor\nimpairment due to the loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons involved in modulating function\nof the basal ganglia (BG). The treatment of PD has traditionally relied on strategies for replacing\nlost dopamine; Levodopa (L-DOPA), the immediate precursor of dopamine, remains the most effective\nPD drug (1). As the disease progresses, however, L-DOPA efficacy becomes unpredictable and many\npatients experience debilitating dyskinesias and behavioral disturbances.  Thus, novel approaches\nfor symptomatic treatment of PD are desperately needed.  New therapeutic agents that bypass the\ndopamine system have the potential of providing more sustained efficacy and fewer side effects or\ncould allow for co-administration with lower doses of L-DOPA to delay the development of adverse\neffects. \nIn recent years, G-protein-linked glutamate receptors, termed metabotropic glutamate receptors\n(mGluRs) have emerged as exciting new targets for PD treatment (2), particularly mGluR8. mGluR8\ndoes not regulate transmission through the BG in normal animals and the mGluR8 agonist (S)-3,4-DCPG\n(DCPG) does not have antiparkinsonian activity in acute models of dopamine depletion or dopamine\nreceptor blockade.  However, DCPG has robust antiparkinsonian effects in rodent models in which\ndopamine is depleted or receptors are blocked for more prolonged periods as well as in animals with\nchronic 6-OHDA-induced lesions of dopamine neurons. Interestingly, DCPG has more robust\nantiparkinsonian activity than do mGluR4 PAMs or mGluR5 antagonists. Furthermore, mGluR8 is not\nwidely expressed in normal animals (3) and the fact that mGluR8 does not regulate BG or motor\nfunction except in animals with chronic parkinsonian motor impairments could provide an ideal\nprofile for a novel antiparkinsonian agent that may be selectively active in PD patients. We and\nothers have found that activities of other mGluR subtypes in the basal ganglia are dramatically\nregulated by loss of dopamine (4-7).  \n\nUsing Human Embryonic Kidney Cells (HEKs) containing rat mGluR8, Poly-D-Lysine coated black/clear\nbottom Greiner 384 well plates, were seeded at 15,000 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 degrees\nC in 5 percent CO2. The next day, FluoZin2 was added to each well and the plate incubated for 50\nminutes at RT. The cells were washed with HBSS + 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4 leaving 20uL residual volume.\nThe cell plate was loaded in to the Hamamatsu FDSS and 5 frames of background were collected before\naddition of compound at 10uM final concentration. Data collection continued at 2 sec intervals\nuntil the addition of EC20 glutamate/thallium stimulus, then the  sampling interval changed to 1\nsec intervals for a total collection time of 4 min. EC20 and ECMax of glutamate controls were used\nto calculate the Z prime value for each window as a measure of assay robustness.\nThe data were processed using an automated data analysis protocol  generated with Pipeline Pilot\n(Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and R statistics package (www.r-project.org). Data were normalized by\ndividing each value in each trace by the initial value for that trace. For each well, 3 windows\nwere calculated as follows: 1)window 1 was the ratio value 5 seconds post-addition of compound;\n2)window 2 was the ratio value 5 seconds pre-addition of EC20/thallium and 3)window 3 was the slope\nvalue between 165 and 175 seconds. Thallium flux modulators or \"hits\" were compounds where Z score\n> 3 or Z < -3 in Window 3. Windows 1 and 2 were used to evaluate fluorescent and environmentally\nsensitive compounds.\nCompounds denoted as 'hits' were given the score of '100' and outcome of 'active'. All other\ncompounds were denoted as 'inactive' and given a score of '0'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian circadian clock by using a chemical\nbiology approach, we analyzed the effect of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC, Sigma)\non the circadian period length that is indicative of the core clock mechanism. We utilized the\ncircadian luciferase reporter Bmal1-dLuc for monitoring circadian rhythms in cultured human cells\nand developed a 384-well plate-based assay system to screen compound libraries. Among the 1,280\ncompounds tested, we identified 11 compounds causing reproducible period changes. Many of them are\npreviously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating the validity of the assay\nsystem. Furthermore, we found that small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)\nconsistently caused a strong short period phenotype. This work was done in collaboration with\nGenomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and The Scripps Research Institute.\nHuman osteosarcoma U2OS cells stably expressing Bmal1-dLuc reporter were suspended in the culture\nmedium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.29 mg/ml L-glutamine, 100 units/ml\npenicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin) and plated onto 384-well white solid-bottom plates\n(Greiner) at 20 ul (2,000 cells) per well. They were cultured for 2 days to reach confluence. Then,\n50 ul of the explant medium [DMEM supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.38\nmg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 0.29 mg/ml L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin,\n0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, and 1 mM luciferin (Promega)] was dispensed to each well, followed by the\napplication of 500 nl of compounds (arrayed on 384-well plates at 1 mM in DMSO) by using 384-well\nhead PinTool (GNF Systems). The plate was covered by an optically clear film (USA Scientific) and\nset to a GNF automated robotic system (GNF Systems) equipped with a CCD imager (ViewLux, Perkin\nElmer) for luminescence recording. The settings are as follows: incubator temperature, 37C;\nexposure time, 120 sec; interval time, 120 min. Raw luminescence data were fit to a damped cosine\ncurve using nonlinear least squares with CellulaRhythm algorithm, and period parameter was\ncalculated. Each period data was normalized by subtracting the mean period of DMSO control\n(included in each plate) and indicated in columns Exp1_Period and Exp2_Period. Positive value means\nlong period, and negative value means short period. The quality of the curve fitting was inspected\nmanually, and the data with poor fitting were filtered out (indicated by blank in columns\nExp1_Period and Exp2_Period). The screening was repeated twice (Exp1 and Exp2), and 13 compounds\ncausing more than 0.5-h period change in both experiments were labeled as active. The 13 primary\nhits were tested in confirmation assay with 8-point dilution series, and the effects of 11\ncompounds were confirmed.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and\nreversibly activates the receptor. An antagonist or inhibitor receptor activation would provide a\nnovel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease\npathology.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor\nresulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.\nA. Brief Description of the Assay:\nThe purpose of this assay is to detect antagonists that inhibit the activation of the Angiotensin\nII receptor-like 1 (Apelin receptor) in the CHO-K1 AGTRL-1 beta-Arrestin Cell Line in 1536-well\nplate format in uHTS mode.\nB.

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay\n\nThe Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase\nsignaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell\nsurface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by\nthe small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs.\nAlternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for\nhigh-throughput screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays\nconsisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of\ntarget for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The\ncompounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR\nmutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of\nthe prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other\nimportant ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1.\n\nThe HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR\nmutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled\nstreptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the\nsubstrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in\nhomogenous assay format.\nMEK protein was obtained\nfrom Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 %\nNaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate.\nThe HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinase TK kit.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good\ntarget for the small organic molecules.  Here, we propose to use unbiased NMR-based screening to\nidentify some small molecules that bind to the DnaK substrate binding domain, which will be further\ndeveloped into potentially chemical tools against DnaK.\n\n1.Protein expression and purification \n\nThe gene coding for the E. coli Dnak substrate binding domain (393-507) was amplified with PCR and\nsubcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites.

Prior to the start of the assay,\ncells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as\nabove, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each well of a 384 well plate\n(8,000 cells/well), followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50\nnL of test compound (50 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO\nalone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA\n(0.7 uM final nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate\nwells. After 4 hours of incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture,\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all\nwells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405\nnm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm / I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported\nEC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50%\nactivation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50\nuM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than\n50 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of\nthe compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity\nscores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.\nList of Reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081)\nHygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part 15140-055)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029)\nCharcoal/dextran-treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03)\nS1P (Biomol, part SL140-0001)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part 85041)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases\n\nThe objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule\nregulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760,\n761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to\nmultiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened\nagainst the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases\nincluding wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP.\nThe assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A\nset of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.\nIn the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets\nwere characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of\nfluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the\npresence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control.\nEach protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on\nGSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min\nat 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the\nsame buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by\nincubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or\n10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold\nBODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer\nin the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery.\nMeasured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular\nequivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the\nfollowing equation;\nkMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept\nwhere MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are\nkiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5\ndifferent levels of calibration beads.\nThe resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in\nGraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation;\nkMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP)\nwhere ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP\nper bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on\ncellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological\ndisorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the\nprotein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with\nmisfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone\nDnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that\ninhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their\nimportance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel\nantibiotics. \nDnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa\nsubstrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638).\nIt has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of\nchaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good\ntarget for the small organic molecules.\nIn an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the\nsubstrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay the most promising hit and its analogs\nwere tested to determine their Minimal Inhibitory Concentration(MIC) for Y.\npseudotuberculosis(YP126) growth.\n\nMaterials:\n1) Testing was done in Mueller-Hinton II broth (BBL). \nProtocols:\n1) Approximately 106 of YP126 bacteria were inoculated into 1 ml of broth containing serial\ndilutions of the compound to be tested.\n2) After overnight incubation at 40 oC, the optical density was read at 600nm and compared to the\ngrowth without inhibitor.\n3) The MIC was read as the concentration producing a greater than 2-fold reduction in growth\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases.\n\nRas and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.  Generally,\nRas proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are\ngeranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these\nprenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. \nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.  The primary screen was performed in 384-well format\nwith 194,655 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 521 potential small\nmolecule inhibitors of Rac wt (AID 757).  \nIn the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary\nscreen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and\ndetermine potency.   \nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and\n0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.\nTest compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially\ndiluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final\ncompound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to\n100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM.\nBeads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response\nexperiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras\nconstitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt,\nRac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound\nworklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce\nannotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an\nExcel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and\nthe fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter\n(SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity\n(MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated.\nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine\ndifferent concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data\npoints. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand\nconcentrations, generating competition curves. \nLigand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA)\nusing nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope,\nalso known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the\nfollowing parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor\nthat inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the\nresponse value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE -\nthe slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE -\nstandard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low\nand high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation\ncoefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit.\nIn order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\n- [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be\nstatistically significant)\n- |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of\nLOGEC50)\n- |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test\ncompound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the\ncompound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 -\n||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|)\nIn this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive\ncompounds the activity score is 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Human liver cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) is a lysosomal cysteine protease. There has been a recent\nresurgence of interest in cathepsin B due to research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is\nrequired for the entry and replication of the Ebola and SARS viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin\nB inhibitors have potential as novel anti-viral agents. \nCathepsin B is also implicated in cancer progression. Upregulation and secretion of this enzyme\noccurs in many types of tumors and correlates positively with their invasive and metastatic\ncapabilities. Cathepsin B facilitates tumor invasion by dissolving extracellular barriers.\nInhibitors of cathepsin B thus have been studied as potential anti-cancer agents.\nTwo high-throughput screens against cathepsin B reported previously under AID 453 and AID 488 each\nindependently revealed the same series of aminopyrazole inhibitors. Six compounds active in the\noriginal HTS were resynthesized, and 21 new compounds were made to explore SAR. As in the original\nHTS and IC50 follow-up, compounds were tested for inhibitory activity in an end-point assay that\nmonitored the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an\nAMC-labeled dipeptide.\nThis assay is a part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN).\nMaterials\nHuman liver cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219362). Substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was\nfrom Bachem (Cat #I-1135.0050). Assay buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium-potassium phosphate,  pH\n6.8 (86 mM potassium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate, monobasic; 7 mm sodium phosphate,\ntribasic), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item\n#3676).\nAssay\nCathepsin B (0.065 ug/mL) was incubated with Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10 uL of assay\nbuffer (see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. Inhibitor IC50 values were determined as described\nbelow.\nIC50 protocol\n1.Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM)\n2.Fill low-volume plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro\n3.Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384\n4.Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool\n5.Add 1 uL of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate (150 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro\n6.Add 5 uL enzyme (0.13 ug/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384\n7.Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature\n8.Read fluorescence (excitation 355, emission 460) on Envision reader\nData analysis\nData were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. IC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls\n(enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23. Each column\n3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration from 50 uM to\n1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in\nfluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using\nthe following equation:\n% Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean))\nDose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic\nfit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3).\n\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary HTS Assay for S1P3 Antagonists,\" (PubChem AID\n485) and that confirmed activity in a subsequent set of experiments entitled, \"Confirmation\ncell-based high throughput screening assay to identify S1P3 antagonists,\" (PubChem AID 1429). In\nthis assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under\nthe control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3\nantagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a\nG-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is\nmeasured using a BLA FRET substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist will\ndecrease well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point 1:3 dilution series,\nstarting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2\nmg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the start\nof the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM\nsupplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and without\nantibiotics.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight\nincubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day 50 nL of test compound in DMSO, or\nDMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Next, S1P (0.7\nmicromolar final nominal concentration) prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was added to the\nappropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate\nmixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was\nadded to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were\nread on the EnVision plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of\n590 nm and 460 nm.\nPrior to normalization data were corrected by subtracting #background# (ie, fluorescence values\nfrom wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values\nwere used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I590 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100*(1-((Ratio_Test_Compound # Median_Ratio_High_Control) /\n(Median_Ratio_Low_Control # Median_Ratio_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. Compounds\nwith an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nActive compounds of this assay fall into the activity score range of 53 to 100 and inactive\ncompounds have range of activity score from 0 to 50.\nList of Reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081)\nHygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part 15140-055)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029)\nCharcoal/dextran-treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03)\nS1P (Biomol, part SL140-0001)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part 85041)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\n384-well Plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) influences heart rate [1,2], coronary artery caliber, endothelial\nintegrity, lung epithelial integrity [3] and lymphocyte recirculation [2,4] through five related\nhigh affinity G-protein coupled receptors [5]. Subtype-selective modulators of S1P receptors will\nbe of broad utility in understanding cell functions in vitro and vascular physiology in vivo, as\nwell as de-convoluting the role of individual subtypes in cellular processes.  The S1P receptor 2\n(S1P2), also known as endothelial differentiation sphingolipid G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (EDG5),\nsignals through Gi, Gq and G12/13 pathways [6] and has been shown to inhibit cell migration in\nseveral cell types [7]. Additionally, many different malignant cells have been shown to overexpress\nS1P2. For example, S1P2 is expressed in melanoma cells [8] and is co-expressed together with S1P3\nin breast cancer cells [9]. Moreover, S1P2 expression has also been found in glioma cells [10] and\nnine gastric cancer cell lines were shown to express S1P2 to varying degrees [11]. Taken together,\nthese observations implicate S1P2 as a potential player in oncogenesis.  As no selective S1P2\nagonist exists, the discovery of selective SIP2 agonists by high-throughput screening will be\nbeneficial for uncovering the physiological and pathological roles of this S1P receptor subtype.\n\nA cell line expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response\nElement (CRE) promoter was used to measure activation of the CRE pathway. Under normal conditions,\nthe cells have low CRE basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels.  Stimulation of\nthe CRE pathway by an agonist induces transcription of the BLA gene in proportion to agonist\nconcentration, resulting in increased BLA activity. This increase is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA\nsubstrate.\nProtocol Summary:\n\nThis assay is a counterscreen for nonspecific activators of the cyclic AMP signaling\npathway.  Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response\nelement (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity. \nThe growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v\nheat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM\nL-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a\nconcentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and\ncontaining 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. \nPrior to assay 10 ul (100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension were dispensed to each well of\n384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to the sample\nor control wells, respectively.   Next, 1.1 ul of forskolin were dispensed to positive control\nwells (final nominal concentration 2 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of PBS was dispensed into negative control\nwells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4\nhours.  After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours\nof incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm.\nPercent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression:\nPercent Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) /\n(median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)]\nWhere:\nWell ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured\nfluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength.\nNegative control wells are defined as wells containing DMSO\nPositive control wells are defined as wells containing 2 uM forskolin\nFor each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in greater than 50 percent\nactivation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 value was determined manually depending on\nthe observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than\n10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 values less than 10 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent\nactivation is observed.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions .\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test\ncompound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and\nAF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive\nControl Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr.\nBruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by\nHyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each\nwell. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound.\nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with\nactivating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have\nRV less than 100.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100,\nmeaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the\nsubstance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. \nAn active compound for RGS16 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 26 and the type of active\ncompound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

In this assay, test compounds are incubated with\nN-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium\ncryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the\ncore106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity,\nallowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well\nFRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the\ntagged antibodies and energy transfer from Europium to XL-665, leading to inhibition of well FRET.\nCompounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM\nDTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were\ndispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with\n2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of\nFlag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 uM\nunlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition),\nand columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of 10-points serial dilutions\nof test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG\nantibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were\ncentrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of\nthe incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well\nfluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer).\nAll wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL\nEu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM\nGST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 uM and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition\ncontrols, respectively.\nTo normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to\ncalculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = ( I671nm / I617nm ) x 10,000\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of\nthree replicate wells, calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 uM of unlabelled Core106 protein.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. Compounds\nwith an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Assay Submitter (PI): Jolanta Grembecka, Tomasz Cierpicki, University of Virginia\nTranslocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors. \nThe present assay was run to confirm the activity of hits from the primary screen using the peptide\nwith a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red.\nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose Response Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists\nof CRE-BLA\n\nA cell line expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response\nElement (CRE) promoter was used to measure nonspecific antagonism of the cAMP signaling pathway.\nUnder normal conditions, the CRE promoter has low basal activity and therefore cells express low\nBLA levels. In this assay, cells have been stimulated with forskolin, which stimulates adenylate\ncyclase, hence increasing BLA gene transcription.  An antagonist is identified as a compound that\nprevents activation by exogenously added forskolin. Therefore, in the presence of a potential\ncyclic AMP pathway antagonist, transcription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic\ncell permeable BLA substrate.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for 61 available of 64 compounds\nthat had greater than 50 percent inhibition and passed hit selection criteria from a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of\nthe Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)\" (PubChem AID = 736). For this assay, a Chinese\nHamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter\nconstruct was used. Dose response curves were also determined for  a set of 22 purchased compounds\nstructurally similar to the hit compound identified in a previous set of experiments entitled,\n#Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)\" (PubChem AID = 736),  #Dose Response Cell Based Assay for\nAntagonists of the S1P2 Receptor# (PubChem AID = 851) and #Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose\nResponse Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists of CRE-BLA# (PubChem AID =856, this assay)\nCells were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity (RH). The growth media\nconsisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated\nbovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL\ngeneticin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. Prior to assay, cells were suspended at a concentration\nof 1.0 million/mL in phenol red free DMEM as above, except without antibiotics and containing 0.5\npercent charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum.\n  \nPrior to the start of the assay, 10 ul of cell suspension (100,000 cells/well) were dispensed into\neach well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2, 95\npercent RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound in DMSO or DMSO (all\ncontrol wells) to sample or control wells, respectively.  Immediately following this dispense, 1 ul\nof forskolin in PBS (final nominal forskolin concentration 2 uM, EC80) to compound wells and\nnegative control wells.  Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed to positive control wells.  Plates were\nincubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul of the\nGeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol\nincluding 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark,\nplates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an\nexcitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm & 460 nm.  \nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio (I460nm/I590nm) where I is defined as the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers as follows:\nPercent Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/ (median_negative_control -\nmedian_positive_control)))*100\nWhere:\nTest_compound is defined as wells containing test compound and forskolin\nPositive control is defined as wells containing PBS\nNegative control is defined as wells containing forskolin alone\nFor each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (39 uM) did not result in > 50 percent inhibition\nor where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\ninhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 uM were\nconsidered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent\ninhibition is observed. This calculation resulted in a conservative estimate of the activity score\nfor compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of\nall compounds tested.\nList of reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part# 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part# SH30541.03) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part# 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part# 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part# 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part# 25030-081)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part# 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part# 15140-122)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part #21063-029)\nCharcoal/dextran treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part# SH30068.03)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part#85041)\nForskolin (Sigma, part#F6886)\nPBS (Invitrogen, part# 14190)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part #K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part# P8761)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Calpains are ubiquitous, calcium-activated cysteine proteases involved in both physiological and\npathological cellular functions.  The two major forms, u-calpain (calpain I) and m-calpain (calpain\nII), are activated by micromolar and millimolar calcium concentrations, respectively.  A current\nand well-supported hypothesis is that cellular injury leads to elevated intracellular calcium and\nprovokes the pathologic activation of calpains.  Activation of calpains is believed to be\nresponsible for the cell death and axonal degeneration seen in many acute and chronic neurological\ndisorders, including stroke, spinal cord and head injuries, and peripheral neuropathies.  Calpain\nactivation leads to degradation of the axonal cytoskeleton, and inhibition of calpains prevents\naxonal degeneration. Despite the importance of calpains in the pathogenesis of axonal degeneration\nin the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, calpains have not been subjected to a\nsystematic small-molecule screen.  We have developed a fluorescent enzyme activity assay in\n1536-well format to identify small molecule inhibitors of calpain II, the isoform most likely to be\ninvolved in axonal degeneration.  This dose response assay measures the calpain II-dependent\nhydrolysis of a self-quenching fluorescent calpain II peptide substrate.  Fluorescence intensity\n(ex. 360 nm and em. 490 nm) is detected with an EnVision plate reader and is proportional to\ncalpain II activity.  \n\nAssay Buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10mM cysteine, 5mM CaCl2, 1mM DTT)\nPurified calpain II (Calbiochem cat # 208715)\nFluorogenic calpain II peptide substrate (Calbiochem cat# 208771)\nPositive control calpain II inhibitor (AK295 peptide, provided by assay PI)\nAssay Protocol:\n1.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a\nprevious set of experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1509) and that confirmed activity in a set\nof experiments entitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (AID 1523). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells\nwhich contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the\nGPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4\nmigrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic,\ncell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate\nS1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution\nseries starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 %\nfinal concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control prepared in 2% fatty-acid\nfree BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 5 uM. Plates\nwere then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the\nLiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing\n10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the\ndark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at\nan excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting #background# for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nActivation =100* ((Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing S1P.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\nactivation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were\nconsidered inactive. Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 48 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 51 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

Recent studies by collaborators and us\nsuggest that VHR is upregulated in several cervix cancer cell lines, in squamous intraepithelial\nlesions, and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix.\nMAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is, like VHR, a dual-specific phosphatase and structurally closely\nrelated to VHR.  MKP-1 also shares a physiological substrate with VHR, namely the extracellular\nsignal-regulated kinases Erk1/2.  Therefore, MKP-1 was chosen to assess the selectivity of the VHR1\ninhibitors reported in AID 2004.\nThis biochemical assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the enzyme's ability to catalyze the \nhydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the presence of an inhibitor.\n\nThe MKP-1-catalyzed hydrolysis of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in the\npresence of compound was assayed at 30 degree Celsius in a 60 ul 96-well format reaction system in\n150 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.0 assay buffer having an ionic strength of 150 mM (adjusted with NaCl) and\ncontaining 1 mM DTT and 5% DMSO.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. \nOne of the many down stream effectors in G protein signaling pathway is the cell surface intergrin\nalpha1beta4 (Very Late Antigen-4, VLA4). The stimulation of formyl peptide receptor (FPR, a GPCR)\nwill subsequently activate the VLA4 signaling pathway. Upon activation, VLA4 binds to the specific\nligand LDV peptide in a high affinity state with a KD of ~0.2 nanoM rather than 12 nanoM at resting\nstate. This process can be monitored by the fluorescent signal from FITC conjugated LDV peptide. \nWhen cells express the non-desensitizing mutant of FPR (FPRdeltaST), the\nduration of VLA4 activation will largely depend on the length of G protein activation. Human\nmonocyte U937 cells that are a natural host of VLA4 and many RGS proteins and stably transfected with FPRdeltaST have been used to\nmonitor VLA-4 affinity changes in live cell assays. We\nadapted this system as a cell-based secondary assay to identify potential small molecule RGS/G\nprotein inhibitor candidates revealed in the bead-based multiplexing screen. Inhibitors of the\nRGS-Galpha interaction have the effect of elongating Galpha signaling; the Galpha signaling pathway\ncan remain #on# for longer periods once activated. Under normal conditions, FPR activation should\nlead to rapid signal increase followed by return to baseline within 100 seconds after activation.\nIn the presence of an RGS-Galpha inhibitor, VLA4 response time should increase. Although the\ndetection signal in this assay reflects the distal end of the signaling pathway, this novel assay\ncan be used as an indicator of possible cell membrane permeable inhibitors that block RGS-Galpha\ninteractions. Once confirmed, the reversibility and toxicity of the identified compound(s) family\nwill be further evaluated, followed by optimizing probe molecules that regulate RGS protein\nfunction in a cellular context.     \nThis assay is an assessment of cell permeability of compounds acting as RGS inhibitors. 500 microL\nof U937 cells at 1 million cells per microL in RPMI1640 media expressing a non-desentizied mutant\nof Formyl Peptide Receptor, DeltaST, and a mini magnetic stir bar are added to a FACs tube.  The\ncells are kept at 37 degrees C under mild stirring at all times. Fluorescence intensity of the\ncells is collected from the FL1 channel of a BD FACScan Flow cytometer equipped with a 530/30nm\nbandpath filter. After recording cell autofluorescence for 20sec, 0.5 microL of 4 microM (or 8\nmicroM) LDVFITC is added to the cells. LDV peptide is the specific binding partner of cell surface\nintegrin Alpha4Beta1 (VLA4) with a KD of 12nanoM at the low affinity state of VLA4 and 0.2 nanoM at\nthe high affinity state [Chigaev, et. al, 2001]. The cells are incubated with LDVFITC for 70 sec in\norder to reach the equilibrium and then activated with either 10 nanoM of fMLF or 10 microM of test\ncompound for an additional 270 sec. \nCalculations:\nDue to the temporal nature of this assay, we utilized the area under the curve for assessing\ndifferences induced by the RGS hit compounds compared with DMSO. First the background fluorescence\nmeasured with 4 nanoM LDVFITC was subtracted from all the data points. Then the area under the\ncurve (AUC) was calculated via the trapezoidal rule from the data collected after the addition of\nfMLF;\nAUC = Sum [(time2 - time1)x 0.5 x (MCF2 + MCF2)]\nwhere MCF1 is the Mean Channel Fluorescence in FL1 measured at time equal to time1, and MCF2 is the\nMean Channel Fluorescence measured at time equal to time2.\nThe comparison between the effect of the compound and DMSO was calculated by ratio of the\nrespective AUCs:\nResponse = 100 x |(AUC_Cmpd/AUC_DMSO) -1|\nwhere AUC_Cmpd is the area under the curve in the presence of tester compound and AUC_DMSO is the\narea under the curve in the presense of carrier, DMSO.  The AUC_DMSO for this experiment was 20093\nMCF-sec.  The Response value is the same as the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE.\nAn active compound have a Response greater than or equal to 25.\nAnnotations of interference of the assay due to innate fluorescence of the compound was made in the\ncolumn titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT. For most of these fluorescent compound, the binding data\nfor LDVFITC were quenched, therefore not yielding any productive data.\n" ;

This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 nuclear receptor\ninteraction domain to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a\nstreptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1\nwith the LBD of ER-alpha, which is induced in the presence of an agonist like estradiol, brings\neuropium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation.

The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2\nwhich are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips\nexon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2\nprotein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1\nlocus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form,\nit is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy\nthat either increase the amount of SMN2 product made or to increase the inclusion of exon 7 has\nbeen proposed for the treatment of SMA.\nWe have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional\nSMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that\ninclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus\ngenerating functional luciferase enzyme.\n\nThis screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter with the major\nportion of the native SMN2 cDNA (exons 1 -7, intron 8 , exon 8 fused to luciferase) stably\nexpressed in HEK293 cells.

The regulator of\nG-protein signaling (RGS)-protein family has important roles in GPCR signal transduction. RGS\nproteins contain a conserved RGS-box, which is often accompanied by other signaling regulatory\nelements. RGS proteins accelerate the deactivation of G proteins to reduce GPCR signaling; however,\nsome also have an effector function and transmit signals. Combining GPCR agonists with RGS\ninhibitors should potentiate responses, and could markedly increase the agonist's regional\nspecificity. The diversity of RGS proteins with highly localized and dynamically regulated\ndistributions in brain makes them attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system\ndisorders. Inhibitors of the RGS:GPCR interaction should prove useful as small molecule tools in\nthis research field. A complex of Gai1 and fluorescently labeled G-alpha-binding peptide (the\n\"GoLoco motif\") derived from RGS12 is incubated with library members.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the\nproduction of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in\nintracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET\n(time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled\nwith Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer\nand the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating\na TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The\nnative unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding\nand reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled\nmolecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be\ndetected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620\nnm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was\nsuccessfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format.\nSelect compounds from the primary screen (AID 1461) were chosen for confirmation based on potency,\nefficacy, SAR, and activity across other assays in PubChem and at NCGC. Other compounds are analogs\nof active compounds from the primary screen.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained\nfrom Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format.

For this primary\nHTS campaign the human T-cell line, Jurkat clone E6.1, was screened against the NIH set of 59,808\ndiverse compounds. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration.\nA luciferase-based cell proliferation/viability assay end point kit was used as the readout for\nthis assay[1]. The kit measures the amount of ATP present in the microtiter plate well. If ATP is\nnot present, the catalytic conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin is not possible, and no\nluminescence results. Since metabolically active cells produce ATP, the absence of ATP correlates\nwith the presence of inviable cells.\nThis campaign was run with doxorubicin, an antibiotic used as an anti-cancer drug, as the positive\ncontrol. In this assay, doxorubicin had a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of approximately\n100 nM. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the\npresence of 4 micromolar doxorubicin (i.e. 100% inhibition). The assay was conducted in 1536-well\nformat.\nTo select a practical number of compounds that exhibited high activity in the primary screen for\nfollow-up assays, a cutoff value of the primary %inhibition was applied. The cutoff value was\ncalculated as the sum of the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested and three times\ntheir standard deviation. In this case 765 unique compounds (1.3 % of all compounds screened) were\nselected as hits.\n\nA suspension of Jurkat cells (clone E6.1; ATCC Cat# TIB-152, Invitrogen Cat# K1045) in RPMI-1640\nmedia containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, 5mM\nL Glutamine, and 1x antibiotic was prepared prior to assay. The concentration of cells in the\nsuspension was 1 million/milliliter. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension\nto each test well of a 1536 well plate. Then 20nL of test compound or control doxorubicin was\nadded. Plates were lidded and incubated at 37 deg C at 5% CO2 for 48 hrs prior to the addition of 5\nmicroliters / well of Cell-Titer Glow (Promega Corp., Madison Wisconsin). After ten minutes of\nincubation at room temperature, plates were read on the Viewlux Imaging UHTS reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland). Percent inhibition was calculated from the median of the positive\ncontrol doxorubicin at 4 micromolar final screening concentration.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors Targeting the Menin-MLL Interaction in MLL Related Leukemias\n\nTranslocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. \nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors. \nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia.

        bat:hasParagraph  "To assign functional characteristics to compounds identified in our previous binding and\ndose-response screens, a functional assay to assess estrogen-mediated translocation of PIP3 was\nemployed. This assay uses the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt (Protein kinase B). This PH\ndomain binds specifically to PI(3,4,5)P3 and, when fused to RFP, can be used as a reporter of PIP3\nlocalization in the cell at different points following stimulation. Stimulation of cells\nco-expressing GPR30 and PH-RFP with estrogen and other GPR30 agonists leads to a translocation of\nPH-RFP from a diffuse cytosolic localization to a nuclear localization. This translocation can be\nblocked using an GPR30 antagonist.\nCos7 cells (ATCC # CRL-1651) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM\nglutamine. 200,000 cells were seeded into 6- well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with\nGPR30-GFP and PH-RFP at a ratio of 3:1 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, per manufacturers\ninstructions). Six hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded onto 12 milliM\nglass coverslips (7500 cells / coverslip) and allowed to adhere for 18 hours, at which point media\nwas changed and cells were grown in phenol-red free, serum-free DMEM F-12 containing Pen/Strep and\n2 milliM glutamine for 24 hours prior to assay.\nTransfected cells were stimulated with compound, vehicle or estrogen to assess PI3K translocation\nin response to estrogen-mediated signaling. To screen for agonist activity, compound was applied to\ncells and incubated at 37 degreesC for 15 minutes. For assessment of antagonist activity, cells\nwere firs incubated with potential antagonist for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, then sitmulated with\nlow-dose estrogen (10 nanoM) for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following stimulation, cells were fixed\nin 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, washed 3x with PBS and mounted using\nVectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Slides were stored at -20 degreesC prior to\nvisualization. \n\nAssessment of translocation of the PI3P reporter, PH-RFP, was visually scored. Compounds which\nfully translocated PH-RFP to the nucleus (equal to estrogen-mediated translocation) were assigned a\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds with a moderate level of PH-RFP translocation were\nassigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 50 and compounds which induced no translocation of PH-RFP were\nassigned a value of 0. \nScoring of antagonists was as completed in a similar manner, with compunds that completely blocked\nestrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100, compounds which\npartially blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a score of 50, and all\ninactive compounds assigned a score of 0.\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME was based on the activity scores, with \"Active\" compunds being those\nwith PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCOREs of 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. \"In-active\"\ncompounds having a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0-50 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man,\nannually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. \nGlucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite,\nthe bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  \nHexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of\nATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that\nHK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is\nlethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been\nunsuccessful.  Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have\nbeen developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. \n\nT. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome\n10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical.  TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian\nHKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and\nhuman HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets.  Indeed, it has been suggested that the\npossibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote (Opperdoes and Michels,\n2001), and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long\nsought-after inhibitors a possibility. \n \nThus, a simple \"mix and read\" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of\nPittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening\nCenter Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the\nenzyme.  \nAssay protocol used as developed for the original High Throughput Screening campaign\nThe basic procedure for the TbHK1 HTS assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture\ncomponents as follows: \n1     15 uL of a 30 uM concentration of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final compound\nconcentration 10 uM). \n2     15 uL of a glucose + ATP + MgCl2 + NAD+ + G6PDH mixture is added with final concentrations of\n0.5mM, 0.35mM, 1.5mM, 3mM, and 0.006mUnits/uL, respectively.\n3     15 uL of TbHK1 enzyme is added per well (final 0.5ng/uL).\n4     Reaction incubates for 2 hours at room temperature. \n5     5 uL EDTA is added (final 50mM). \n6     Data was captured at A340 and represents the increase in NADH  \n      in the reaction mixture. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor\n\nA cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP\nResponse Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to identify compounds that\ninhibit S1P2 activity. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and the cells express\nlow BLA levels. Treatment of the cells with an S1P agonist stimulates the S1P2 receptor and\nactivates BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents\nactivation by S1P, and as a result decreases transcription of the BLA gene. This decrease is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic\ncell permeable BLA substrate. \n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for 61 available of 64 compounds\nthat had greater than 50 percent inhibition and passed hit selection criteria from a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of\nthe Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)\" (PubChem AID = 736). Dose response curves were\nsubsequently determined for a set of 22 purchased compounds structurally similar to the hit\ncompound (SID 14730083, SID 46371185) identified in a set of experiments entitled \"Dose Response\nCell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor\" (PubChem AID = 851, this experiment) and\n\"Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose Response Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists of\nCRE-BLA\" (PubChem AID =856).  \n \nA Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with both the S1P2 receptor and a cyclic\nAMP response element (CRE) reporter construct was used. Cells were cultured 37 degrees C and 95\npercent relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media\n(DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL geneticin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.\n \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM\nas above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran\ntreated fetal bovine serum.  Next, 10 ul(100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension was dispensed into\neach well of the assay plates and incubate in the plates for 20 hrs at 37 degrees C, 5 percent CO2\nand 95 percent RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound in DMSO, DMSO\n(negative control wells) or JTE-013 (final nominal concentration 3 uM, positive control wells) to\nthe appropriate wells.  Immediately after this dispense, 1 ul of S1P in 2 percent BSA (final\nconcentration of 750 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80 percent activity) was dispensed\ninto negative control wells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5\npercent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate\nmixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol including 15 mM probenecid) was added.\nAfter 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate\nreader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm.  \nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio (I460nm/I590nm) where I is defined as the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers as follows:\nPercent Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/ (median_negative_control -\nmedian_positive_control)))*100\nWhere:\nTest compound is defined as wells containing test compound and 750nM S1P\nPositive control is defined as wells containing 3 uM JTE-013 alone (100 percent inhibition) \nNegative control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 750 nM S1P (0 percent inhibition) \nFor each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in > 50 percent inhibition\nor where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\ninhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 uM were\nconsidered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated from pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was\ncalculated and is based on the observed pIC50 range.  Specifically, the maximum lower limit of the\npIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent\ninhibition is observed. This calculation resulted in a conservative estimate of the activity score\nfor compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of\nall compounds tested.\nList of reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part# 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part# SH30541.03) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part# 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part# 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part# 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part# 25030-081)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part# 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part# 15140-122)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen, part #21063-029)\nCharcoal/dextran treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part# SH30068.03)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part#85041)\nS1P (Biomol, part# SL140-0001)\nPBS (Invitrogen, part# 14190)\nJTE-013  (Cayman Chemical, part#10009458)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part #K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part# P8761)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors.\nThe present assay was run to characterize initial structure activity relationships.\nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the\nactivity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication.\nDue to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB\nactivity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding\nprotein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2,\n3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which belongs to the DUF1234 domain\nsuperfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported,\nthis protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that\nit is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was\nrecently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad\n(4). A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation is supported by studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA\nexpression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3).\nFurthermore, RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3),\nand RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-&#946;1-induced growth inhibition through its\ninteraction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in\ngender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the\nidentification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for\nthe study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis.\nThis cytotoxicity counterscreen was performed as part of a probe development effort to identify\ninhibitor probes of RBBP9 belonging to the oxime ester scaffold.\n\nLate stage, HEK 293T cells, cytotoxicity, luminescence, viability, Probes, RBBP9, retinoblastoma\nbinding protein 9, BOG, cell cycle, cancer, fluorescence polarization, fluorophosphonate rhodamine,\nFP-Rh, antagonist, inhibitor, primary, confirmation, gel-based ABPP, HTS, 1536, Scripps, Scripps\nFlorida, Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center, SRIMSC, Molecular Libraries Probe\nProduction Centers Network, MLPCN.\nAssay Overview:\nPlease see AIDs 1515 and 1537, Summary AID 1790, and below for all protocols performed in this\nprobe development effort. The purpose of this assay is to determine cytotoxicity of inhibitor\ncompounds belonging to the oxime ester scaffold. In this assay, HEK cells are incubated with test\ncompounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo\nluminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular\nATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed,\ncompounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light\nproduction, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a\n10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThis assay was started by dispensing 5 x 10E3 HEK 293T cells/well into a 96-well plate. Compound\n(0.001-100 mM) or DMSO was added to each well, and after 48h cell viability was determined by the\nCellTitre assay (Promega). \n" ;

The fusion\nprotein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that\npromote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities,\nallowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as\nan agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution\nseries starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100 mM\nSodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns\nwere filled with 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3\nmicrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2\nprotein [aa 624-829].\nNext, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL\nof GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO alone (0.8% final\nconcentration) into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees\nCelsius and fluorescence was measured. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored\nat 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical\nexpression:\nRatio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl))\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds\nwith an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 54 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 54 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part 71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC-2 protein [aa 624-829] (produced by Dr. Scott Busby, Scripps Florida).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH)\nfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).  The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular\nprocesses suggests a critical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological\nconditions.  Small molecule BAP1 inhibitors were identified using a kinetic, high-throughput BAP1\nactivity assay (AID 436).  In this assay, ubiquitin conjugated to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC)\nwas used as a BAP1 substrate.  Hydrolysis of UbAMC by BAP1 results in the release of free AMC and\nan increase in fluorescence.  The reaction velocity is measured as the increase in fluorescence\nover time and is proportional to BAP1 activity.  Compounds identified in the initial single-dose\nscreen have been confirmed in dose response using the same assay format.  \nTo date, UbAMC is the only substrate commercially available for in vitro DUB activity assays. \nHowever, the excitation/emission wavelengths of AMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm) overlap with those of\nmany small molecules, which leads to a high percentage of fluorescence artifacts.  To overcome the\nproblem of interference by compound autofluorescence, we replaced UbAMC with\nubiquitin-rhodamine(110)-glycine (UbRHO).  The excitiation/emission wavelegths of RHO (ex. 485 nm,\nem. 520 nm) are right-shifted compared to those of AMC and therefore has less overlap with\nautofluorescent compounds.  RHO also generates a much stronger fluorescent signal, which greatly\nincreases assay sensitivity, signal-to-background ratio, and allows for the use of less substrate. \nTo test selectivity for BAP1, hit compounds were also tested in parallel against UCH-L1, a closely\nrelated DUB in the UCH family.  Selectivity data for selected compounds are also presented in this\nassay.  \nAnalogs of hits identified in the BAP1 primary screen (AID 436) were tested in this assay.  Each\ncompound was tested at 8-11 concentrations in 1:2 serial dilutions from the highest concentration\n(50-100 micromolar). Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  \nProcedure:\n1. Dilute BAP1 (provided by assay PI), L1 (Boston Biochem cat# E-340), and UbRHO (provided by assay\nPI) in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 25-100 mM NaCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 5 mM DTT). \nKeep on ice and protect UbRHO from light.\n2. Add 12.5 ul of BAP1 or L1 (5 nM final) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls.\n3. Transfer 0.5 uL compounds to 384-well plate to arrive at final compound concentrations.\n4. Add 12.5 ul 50-100 nM UbRHO (50 nM final for BAP1, 25-50 nM final for L1)\n5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using kinetic\nsettings.  The plate was read every 1 minute 45 seconds for 10 readings using a 505 nm dichroic\nmirror (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm). \n6.  All compounds were tested in triplicate\nData analysis:\nAssay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. The velocity was calculated\nusing the slope from a linear fit of the individual readings. Where appropriate, data points\nrecorded at times beyond the linear range of reaction were omitted from velocity determination. \nThe average velocity of the blank wells for the plate was subtracted from each compound velocity.\nThe blank-subtracted values were then normalized to the negative controls to arrive at the average\nPercentage of Control for each concentration.  BAP1 selectivity is represented as the as the ratio\nof BAP1 and L1 IC50 values (i.e. the higher the ratio, the more selective for BAP1). \nFor each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using software from the R\nProject for Statistical Computing.\nThis assay was used to evaluate the relative potency (IC50) and selectivity of active compounds as\nBAP1 inhibitors.  All compounds were marked as active, and all compounds given an activity score of\n100.\n \n" ;

SF-1 is a nuclear receptor that does not share significant structural homology with\nRORA at the ligand-binding domain.\nThis counterscreen employs the same format as the assay used to select potential RORA inhibitors;\nexcept that here the biological target is SF-1. A compound that appears as an inhibitor in both the\nRORA and SF-1 assays would be less desirable for follow-up, since the compound may be a\nnon-selective inhibitor or format-specific artifact. On the other hand, compounds found inactive in\nthis assay and confirmed active in RORA dose-response experiments are likely to be selective\ninhibitors of RORA.\nThis dose-response counterscreen assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast\ntranscriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the\npFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4\nresponse elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hSF-1 and pG5-luc plasmids\nare transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell\nline of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated SF-1 nuclear\nreceptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the\nsuppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer).\nSuch compounds hence constitute false-positive inhibitors of the RORA nuclear receptor. \nAmong 278 compounds selected during the primary screening, 273 compounds were assessed in\ndose-response experiments in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 100 micromolar.\nThis assay was conducted in 1536-well format.\n" ;

Cells were then counted and expanded (see below).\n3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally\nused 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency.\n4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media\nprewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles.\n5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well\nin 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a\nsterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood.\n6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX\n2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight.\n7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by\nproject collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that\nare labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30\nnanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom\nexcitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a\nsingle bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0\nsupplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing.\nThe 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below)\nare centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50\nmilliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then\nresuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated\nwork station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10\nminutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10\nmilliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds\nRGS proteins with high affinity.\nThis design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is\nassociated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead\nsets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635\nnanom. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7\nmight be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead\nsets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into\n384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead\ncontrol (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a\nfluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the\ntest compounds.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters\n(5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test\ncompound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is\n10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test\ncompound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are\nincubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for\neach well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of\n218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds.\nRGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of\nthe measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative\ncontrol bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that\nparticular protein is \"inconclusive\", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive\n(see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS\nProtein is \"inconclusive\", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant\namounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702\ncompounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. \nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound\n(|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or\ninhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the\ntarget RGS-Galphao interaction. \nRV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and\nRGS7, compounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8,\ncompounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library\ndependent \"edge effect\" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the\ndata set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered \"Active\". Data from compounds\nlocated in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than\n0 or greater than 135 were considered \"Active\". Active compounds include both activators - where\n%Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the\n218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as\npotential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per\nprotein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are\nRGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific.\nRGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel,\nwhich can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has\nthe lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest\nbead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead\nset, the compound is flagged as \"Potential Red Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as\npotential red fluorescent compounds.\nThe Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library,\naverage Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when\nexcluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard\ndeviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for\ntarget RGS16, due to the library dependent \"edge effect\", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68\nstandard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity\nof the protein.\nFor easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the\nsame compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an\nactivator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column\nRi_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where \"i\" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The intraerythrocytic stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum employs two\ncytosolic neutral aminopeptidases, an M1-family alanyl aminopeptidase (M1AAP) and an M17-family\nleucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP), in the terminal stages of host hemoglobin digestion. Their action\nresults in the release of free amino acids that are used for the anabolism of parasite proteins\nand, hence, are critical to the development of the parasite in red blood cells. Inhibitors of the\ntwo exopeptidases prevent the growth of P. falciparum parasites in vitro, and protect mice from\ninfection with rodent malaria P. chabaudi, providing strong evidence that these enzymes are targets\nwhich can be used to develop new anti-malarial drugs.  Thus, Plasmodium falciparum M17-family\nleucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP) is an attractive chemotherapeutic target and was used to screen a\nlarge (200K) chemical library to identify novel inhibitors as probes for this enzyme in Plasmodium\nfalciparum.\n \nA simple assay using a fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) was used for quantifying the\nactivity of M17LAP. The rate of hydrolysis of this substrate was measured by monitoring the release\nof the -NHMec fluorogenic leaving group at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission\nwavelength of 460nm.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that\nfluoresce at these wavelengths.\nA total of 217,147 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 30 uM.  For\nfollow-up testing, the 1139 most potent inhibitors were tested in a dose response assay at\nconcentrations ranging from 100-1.0 uM.\nM17LAP Assay Protocol for 1536-well HT\nPurified recombinant M17LAP enzyme was provided by Prof. John Dalton, Institute for the\nBiotechnology of Infectious Diseases (IBID) University of Technology Sydney.\nCompound Dosing/Plating: For the primary screen 15 nl of compounds in DMSO were dispensed into\n1536-well black non-binding surface plates. This resulted in a concentration of 30 uM of compound\nin the assay.  For the follow up dose response assays 8 concentrations of each compound ranging\nfrom 100-1 uM were used.\nAssay Setup: 2.5 uL of M17LAP reagent mix, which included the fluorogenic peptide substrate\n(H-Leu-NHMec) in assay buffer, was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 1536-well\nplates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 2.5 uL of the M17LAP diluted in assay\nbuffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.1 mM H-Leu-NHMec and 100 ug/ml M17LAP\ndiluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2% DMSO). The test plate\nwas immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and fluorescence was\nmeasured at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm at 35 second\nintervals for 315 seconds (10 readings). Each plate had 256 control wells in the eight outside\ncolumns with 128 wells containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full\nreaction) and 128 wells in which the M17LAP had been left out (background). \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Chronic pain (neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, cancer pain) is a major health problem.\nOpiate-based drugs, such as morphine and morphine derivatives, are the primary standard of care for\nthe treatment of chronic pain.  Unfortunately, patients develop tolerance to opiates due to\ndesensitization of the opiate receptor.  Thus, alternative anti-nociceptive (\"pain killing\")\npathways need to be explored for treatment of chronic pain. \nThe N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV2.2s) in dorsal root ganglia neurons is a well validated\ntarget for chronic pain (1, 2). We previously demonstrated the interaction between CaV2.2 and the\nfirst PDZ domain of molecular adaptor protein Mint1 (3). In additional experiments we demonstrated\nthat carboxyl-terminal association of CaV2.2 protein with the Mint1-PDZ domain plays an important\nrole in synaptic targeting and function of N-type Ca2+ channels (4). \nThe following describes a homogeneous terbium time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(HTRF) HTS assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of association between Mint1-PDZ domains and\ncarboxyl-terminal peptide present in the long C-terminal splice variant of CaV2.2 pore-forming\nsubunit of N-type calcium channels (NC peptide).  Compounds that disrupt the interaction would\nresult in decrease of TR-FRET ratio and are detected in the assay. The C-terminal sequence in rat\nand human CaV2.2 sequences are highly conserved.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Late stage results from the probe development effort to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma\nBinding Protein 9 (RBBP9): Gel-based Activity-Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) Inhibition.\n\nThe retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the\nactivity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication.\nDue to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB\nactivity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding\nprotein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2,\n3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which belongs to the DUF1234 domain\nsuperfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported,\nthis protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that\nit is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was\nrecently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad\n(4). A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation is supported by studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA\nexpression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3).\nFurthermore, RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3),\nand RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-&#946;1-induced growth inhibition through its\ninteraction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in\ngender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the\nidentification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for\nthe study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis.\nThis gel-based activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) inhibition assay was performed as part of a\nprobe development effort to identify inhibitor probes of RBBP9 belonging to the oxime ester\nscaffold.\n\nPlease see AIDs 1515 and 1537, Summary AID 1790, and below for all protocols performed in this\nprobe development effort. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified\nas active in the uHTS primary (AID 1515) and confirmation screens (AID 1537). In this assay, a\nfluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase\nfamily is used to label RBBP9 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction products are\nseparated by SDS-PAGE and visualized in-gel using a flatbed fluorescence scanner. The percentage\nactivity remaining is determined by measuring the integrated optical density of the bands. As\ndesigned, test compounds that act as RBBP9 inhibitors will prevent RBBP9-probe interactions,\nthereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe, leading to low fluorescence\npolarization in the band in the gel. Percent inhibition of recombinant RBBP9 (compound at 20 uM)\nwas determined.\nProtocol Summary: \nRecombinant RBBP9 (2 mM) in assay buffer was incubated with DMSO or compound (20 mM) for 30 min at\n25 degrees Celsius before the addition of FP-rhodamine at a final concentration of 75 nM in 50 ml\ntotal reaction volume. The reaction was incubated for 45 min at 25 degrees Celsius, quenched with\n2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min at 90 degrees Celsius, separated by SDS-PAGE and\nvisualized in-gel. The percentage activity remaining was determined by measuring the integrated\noptical density of the bands.\nList of Reagents: \nRecombinant RBBP9 protein (provided by Assay Provider)\nFP-rhodamine (provided by Assay Provider)\nSodium Chloride (Fisher, part 980597)\n1M Tris, pH 8.0 (Invitrogen, part T-3038)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase\nsignaling pathway  (ERK1/2 cascade) plays a key role in transmitting signals from the cell surface\nto the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by the\nsmall G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs. Alternatively,\nthis pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP, or by activation of a receptor\ntyrosine kinase as epidermal growth factor receptor.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for high\nthroughout screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To exclude the assay-related false positives, we used a biotinylated\nrabbit IgG to perform counter-screen. The biotinylated antibody mimics the phosphorylated ERK1/2\nfor bringing streptavidin coated beads and protein-A coated beads to a proximity range for the\nAlphaScreen detection.\n\nHEK293 cells stably expressing type-1 vasopressin receptor (V1b) were maintained in DMEM medium\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The\nmedium contained 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, non-essential amino acid, pyruvate and 50 U/ml\npenicillin and 50 ug/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The aliquots of frozen cells were stored at\n-135C and used for the compound screening. All compounds were screened as titrations from 0.6 nM to\n46 uM final concentration. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was used to stimulate the ERK\nphosphorylation pathway. The ERK phosphorylation in cells was determined using an AlphaScreen assay\nkit provided by PerkinElmer. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only)\nand 100% activation (25 nM EGF). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response data\nmodeled with the standard Hill equation.\n(1) Seed 4 ul/well of resuspended frozen HEK293 cells containing 2000 cells in white 1536-well\nplates for overnight with 1% FBS at 37C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95%\nair.\n(2) Add 23 nL compounds in DMSO solution.

The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to\nmultiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened\nagainst the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases\nincluding wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP.\nThe assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A\nset of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.\nIn the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets\nwere characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of\nfluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the\npresence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control.\nEach protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on\nGSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min\nat 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the\nsame buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by\nincubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or\n10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold\nBODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer\nin the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery.\nMeasured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular\nequivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the\nfollowing equation;\nkMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept\nwhere MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are\nkiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5\ndifferent levels of calibration beads.\nThe resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in\nGraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation;\nkMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP)\nwhere ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP\nper bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and\nplay important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems.\nOf these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic\ntargets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of\ncholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs.\nDue to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the\nmAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been\nlargely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been\nimpossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a\nM1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and\nan antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like\nprofile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the\nantipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of\nM1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion\nthat a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide\nantipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by\nrecent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and\ndopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine\nhyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered\nhippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide\na novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1\nmay also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the\nrelative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or\nantipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly\nselective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it\nimpossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.\nThe purpose of this experiment was to test compounds of interest for their ability to modulate\n[3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding at the rat M4 muscarinic receptor. \nCompetition binding assays were carried out essentially as described in with\n25 mg of membrane protein prepared from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and 0.1nM\n[3H]-N-methylscopolamine (GE Healthcare) in a final volume of 1mL.  Non-specific binding was\ndetermined in the presence of 1 mM atropine.   A full atropine CRC was determined as a positive\ncontrol. The compounds did not affect binding of the orthosteric ligand [3H]-NMS suggesting an\nallosteric modulation for the lead compounds. 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was\nassigned as \"0'.\n" ;

Compounds were tested in singlicate.\n\nCells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).\nThe growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine,\n2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the\nstart of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free\nDMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no\nantibiotics.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well followed by\novernight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5\nmicromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 %\nfinal concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 1% BSA (0.8 micromolar\nfinal nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate wells.\nAfter 4 hours of incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture,\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all\nwells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405\nnm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The purpose of this assay is to confirm mutant JAK2V617F inhibition activity of compounds\nidentified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput\nscreening assay to identify inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617F\" (PubChem AID 1446), and inactive in\na previous set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen for inhibitors of mutant JAK2V617F:\nCell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of parental Ba/F3 cell viability\"\n(PubChem AID 1486). This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses EpoR\nand JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is\ncytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent,\nwhich contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light\nin the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell\nviability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well\nluminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.6 uM.\n\nThe BaF3 EpoR-JAK2V617F cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media was RPMI 1640 Glutamax-1 medium containing 10% FBS\n(v/v), 1X penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mix.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells per mL in\nphenol red-free RPMI supplemented as above. The assay was started by dispensing 5 ul of cell\nsuspension to each well. Next, 28 nL of test compound (5.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO,\nDMSO alone (0.56 % final concentration, set as 0% inhibition), or JAK inhibitor I (5.6 micromolar\nfinal nominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO was added to the appropriate wells.\nAfter 72 hours incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, the plates were removed from the incubator and\nallowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 5 ul of Cell-Titer Glo reagent was\nadded to all wells and the plates were allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Well\nluminescence was recorded for 30 seconds per well using the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer, Turku,\nFinland).\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "eIF2B is a translation initiation factor that functions in the first step of protein synthesis. It\nis a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), converting eIF2 (inactive GDP-bound form) to eIF2GTP\n(active). Mutations of eIF2B manifest as a dysfunction in brain myelin leading to its progressive\nloss. This causes fatal conditions known as Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination syndrome\n(CACH) and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM). As eIF2B is a universally\nconserved protein among eukaryotic organisms, a cellular assay system has been developed using\nyeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (wild type and eIF2B-epsilon-R284H mutant). Yeast\neIF2B-epsilon-R284H is equivalent to the human eIF2B5-R299H mutation. The HTS is aimed at\nidentifying compounds that can restore eIF2B function. \n\nThe screen is a reporter-gene assay. GCN4 activity is inversely proportional to eIF2B function in\ncells. Thus cells with eIF2B mutations exhibit aberrantly high GCN4 expression. The mutant cells\ncontain a chromosomally-integrated gene-fusion to beta-galactosidase. Beta-Galactosidase monitoring\nthus indirectly measures GCN4 levels and, in turn, eIF2B activity. To perform the assay, we have\nadapted a coupled beta-galactosidase/ firefly luciferase system (Promega) for use with yeast cells\nand in HTS format. The growth of mutant and wildtype yeast in the presence of each compound was\nalso monitored and used as a measure of compound toxicity.\n\nMutant yeast cells were grown in 384-well polypropylene plates sealed with Breathe-Easy membranes\nat 30 C for 16 hrs. After 16 hrs, the cells were mixed using Perkin Elmer Evolution by repeated\naspirate-dispense cycles using 30 uL disposable tips. A portion of the cell suspension was lysed\nwith Z-buffer (82 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 9 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1% SDS) in a\nwhite 384-well plate. Beta-Glo reagent was added to the lysed cells, and luminescence was measured\nafter 90 min. at room temperature. The remaining cells were transferred to a clear 384-well plate\nand absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Perkin Elmer Envision spectrophotometer. HTS was\nperformed using 25 uM compound as described below. The screen was repeated using the wild-type\nyeast cells as a filter to identify compounds having a non-specific effect on the luminescence of\nboth mutant and wild-type yeast.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening\nassay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3).\n\n\nIn this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene\nunder control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3\nantagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a\nG-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is\nmeasured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist\nwill decrease NFAT-BLA transcription and decrease well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in\ntriplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25\nmicromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine,\n2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the\nstart of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free\nDMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no\nantibiotics. \nThe assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well followed by\novernight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5\nmicromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 %\nfinal concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 1% BSA (0.8 micromolar\nfinal nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate wells.\nAfter 4 hours of incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture,\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all\nwells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405\nnm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm \nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( (Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control\n- Median_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of Reagents: \nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081)\nHygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part 15140-055)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029)\nCharcoal/dextran-treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03)\nS1P (Biomol, part SL140-0001)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part 85041)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a\ncommercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in\ninduced RGS4 expressed cells are considered agonist hits. M3 receptor and other endogenous receptor\ninhibitors will be excluded through later counter-screening against non-induced parental cells.\nProtocol for RGS4 Primary Screen:\n1.

Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate,\nas well as Z and Z prime factors [26]\n14. Calculate B scores [27] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12\n15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard\ndeviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds above the mean (B\nscore ratio>3*SD+mean), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the\nstandard deviation plus or minus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is\ndesignated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an inhibitor of RGS4.  Otherwise, it is designated\nas inactive (value=1). \n16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation\nof Int(((Log(ABS(B score ratio))-0.6)/1.25)*100), they are normalized to the smallest and largest\nLOG(B score ratio), B score ratio, as in the result definition.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked\nalpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is\nrequired for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency\nof this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe\ndisease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes\nand cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within\nlysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In\nturn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy\nand muscle weakness).\nIt has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the\ngenetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin,\nan inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity,\nwhich significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this\nalpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule\ninhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new\npharmacological chaperones.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions .\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, \nRGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test\ncompound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and\nAF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive\nControl Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr.\nBruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by\nHyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each\nwell. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound.\nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with\nactivating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have\nRV less than 100.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100,\nmeaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the\nsubstance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. \nAn active compound for RGS19 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 50 and the type of active\ncompound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "TSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland\nwhich belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a\nseven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s)\nprotein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5'\nmonophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and\nregulates their growth and function. This cell based assay was conducted on a TSHR transfected HEK\n293 cell line, measuring cAMP stimulation using antibody-based Homogeneous Time Resolved\nFluorescence (HTRF).\nOur goal is to identify small molecules that will inhibit (antagonize) the thyroid-stimulating\nhormone receptor (TSHR), a member of the 7 transmembrane-spanning receptor (7TMR) family of cell\nsurface receptors. TSHR-mediated hyperthyroidism is important in thyroid pathology.  The\ndevelopment of small molecule antagonists of TSHR may lead to therapeutic approaches for\nTSHR-mediated hyperthyroidism caused by constitutively activating mutations or stimulating\nauto-antibodies associated with Graves' disease.  Graves' disease is the leading cause of\nhyperthyroidism and is caused by autoantibodies that stimulate TSHR (TsAbs) causing thyroid growth\nand unregulated overproduction of thyroid hormones and existing treatments have liabilities\n(agranulocytosis). In addition, TSHRs are known to be expressed in multiple extrathyroidal tissues\nincluding bone, brain, kidney, testis, fat and cells of the immune system but the role of the TSHR\nin these tissues is not clear.  Therefore, TSHR antagonists/inverse agonists could be used as\nprobes of extrathyroidal TSHR function. Finally, TSHR inverse agonists, which are a subclass of\nantagonists that inhibit agonist-independent (or basal or constitutive) TSHR signaling, could be\nused to inhibit TSH-independent signaling in patients with recurrent or metastatic thyroid cancer\nwho are receiving thyroid hormone to suppress TSH.\nAn anti cAMP antibody contains a fluorescent cryptate tag (excitation 337 nm; emission 620 nm) and\nthe acceptor is cAMP-d2 (excitation 620 nm; emission 665 nm). When antibody and cAMP-d2 interact\nand are excited by a 337 nm light, a FRET occurs resulting in emission at 665 nm. The assay is\ncompetition between cAMP-d2 and cAMP (from the cell lysate).

Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.

Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the\narrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to\ncoated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the\nGFP-arrestins.\nAssay Materials:\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR1\nreceptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics\n- 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution:  (Dynorphin-A, American Peptide #24450 - 5mM stock in DMSO)\ndiluted in water to 10uM.  \n5) Negative Control Working Solution: Naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate (Sigma N7758)- 5mM stock\ndiluted to 5uM in water.\n6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO\n7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer\n(10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAssay Procedure:\n1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of\ncompounds. \n4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The \"dose response protocol\" was used\nto dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate.\na. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten\ndoses), in duplicate.\nb. Positive control was added to column 1.  Dynorphin final concentration was 1uM.\nc.

There are also forms of the disorder affecting the central nervous system. Patients with the\nsame genotypes can manifest with diverse clinical presentations and it is believed that improper\nfolding and trafficking of beta-glucocerbrosidase may contribute to the phenotypes observed.\nLow molecular weight molecules, acting as chaperones, may potentially restore trafficking of\nmisfolded beta-glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes, thereby\nenhancing functional lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity.\nUsing normal beta-glucocerebrosidase, an assay was developed to screen for small molecule\ninhibitors that could potentially act as molecular chaperones on the mutant forms. \nA pro-fluorescent substrate was chosen for a\nscreen against a small molecule library. The beta-glucocerebrosidase assay used Resorufin\nbeta-D-Glucopyranoside (Marker Gene Technology Inc.), generating a red fluorescent product. The Km\nfor the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside was determined to be 71.2 uM. The IC50 values of\nConduritol B Epoxide, a known glucocerebrosidase inhibitor, was determined to be 87.5 uM. All\ncompounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s). To confirm\nactivity from the original screen, samples were reacquired from MLSCN and also synthesized\nin-house, and re-screened against the original assay at a higher density of titration points.\n\nBoth enzyme and substrate were diluted in buffer composed of 50mM citric acid/KH2PO4, 10mM sodium\ntaurocholate and 0.01% tween-20 at pH 5.9. The final concentration of the enzyme was 0.2 nM in both\nassays. The compound library was titrated in 7 to 15 concentrations for the primary screens with a\nfinal concentration ranging from 0.6 nM to 50 uM.

There are growing concerns about\nthe cognitive effects of known general anesthetics [1] and acceleration of the onset of\nneurodegenerative disease [2]. The compounds' toxicity [3] and multiple specific binding targets in\nthe mammalian brain [4] has made them less attractive as drug leads. In this assay, a GABAergic\nmimetic model system, apoferritin and a profluorescent 1-aminoanthracene ligand (1-AMA), was used\nto construct a competitive binding assay for identification of novel general anesthetics. The assay\nwas validated for 1-AMA using other known anesthetics, such as isoflurane (CID:3763) and propofol\n(CID: 4943) [5], [6].  This particular BioAssay is a confirmation of followup compounds from\nprimary screen AID:485281.\n\nThree uL of reagents (free 1-AMA (50% saturated solution of 1-aminoanthracene \nin PBS) in columns 3, 4 as negative control and 1-AMA/apoferritin mixture (10 uM horse-spleen\napoferritin in 50% saturated 1-aminoanthracene in PBS) in columns 1, 2, 5-48) was dispensed into\n1536-well Greiner black assay plates.

A\nLANCE/DELFIA dichroic mirror with a cutoff wavelength at 400 nm was used to maximize signal\naccuracy and strength. Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire column\n5-48 compound area, were inserted uniformly at the beginning and the end of each library in order\nto monitor for and record any shifts in the background. Activity was computed as the normalized\nfluorescence response relative to free 1-AMA and 1-AMA/apoferritin complex values.\nConcentration-effect relationships were derived by using curve fitting algorithms developed\nin-house (http://ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts/).

The growth media consisted of\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth\nserum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x\npenicillin-streptomycin.

Prior to assay 10 ul(100, 000 cells/well) of cell\nsuspension was dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37\ndegrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the\nMLSCN library or DMSO control to sample or control wells, respectively.  Next, 1.1 ul of S1P in 2\npercent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 1\nuM).  Then, 1.1 ul of 2 percent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to negative control and test\ncompound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours.

Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were\nconsidered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent\nactivation is observed.

Recent interest in\ncathepsin L has been generated by research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for\nthe entry and replication of the SARS and Ebola viruses in human cells. Thus cathepsin L inhibitors\nhave potential as novel anti-viral agents.\nCathepsin L inhibitors may also be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible\nfor human malaria. Plasmodium contains cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases known as falcipains that\nappear to promote virulence of the parasite through haemoglobin digestion and erythrocyte invasion.\nA high-throughput screen for cathepsin L inhibitors was designed as an end-point assay monitoring\nthe release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an\nAMC-labeled dipeptide. Primary HTS results and dose-response confirmation have been reported\npreviously (AIDs 460 and 825). Confirmed actives from dose-response testing were retested using\ncysteine in the assay buffer instead of DTT. This allows the exclusion of DTT-reactive artifacts\nthat inactivate the enzyme in the presence of DTT but are inactive in the presence of cysteine.\n\nHuman liver cathepsin L was purchased from Calbiochem (Cat #219402). Substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA,\nand 5 mM cysteine. Low-volume 384-well black plates were from Corning (Item #3676).\n\nCathepsin L (8.7 ng/mL) was incubated with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (1 uM) in 10 uL of assay buffer\n(see above) for 1 hr at room temperature. HTS actives were confirmed by IC50 determination as\ndescribed below.\nIC50 protocol\n1. Serial dilute compounds at 50x concentration in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75\nnM)\n2. Fill Corning low-volume 384-well black plate with 4 uL water using Multidrop-micro\n3. Add 5 uL assay buffer to columns 1 and 23 using Multidrop-384\n4. Add 200 nL of compound (in DMSO from step 1) using Evolution pintool\n5. Add 1 uL of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate (10 uM in 5x assay buffer) using Multidrop-micro\n6. Add 5 uL enzyme (17.4 ng/mL in assay buffer) using Multidrop-384\n7. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature\n8. Read fluorescence (excitation 360, emission 460) on Envision reader\nData analysis\nData were analyzed in IDBS ActivityBase. Each IC50 plate contained compounds in columns 3-22,\ncontrols (enzyme, no compound) in columns 2 and 24, and blanks (no enzyme) in columns 1 and 23.\nEach column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions of a single compound, ranging in concentration\nfrom 50 uM to 1.5 nM. Percent activity was calculated for each dilution of each compound from the\nsignal in fluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate\nblanks using the following equation:\n% Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean))\nDose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205. (Four parameter\nlogistic fit; maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0,\nrespectively; Hill slope limited to > -0.1.)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Escherichia coli DnaK, a homolog of heat shock protein 70, has been shown to protect denature\nproteins from aggregation and promote their refolding by ATP hydrolysis. DnaK, along with its two\nco-cohort proteins DnaJ and GrpE, forms a microbial chaperone system that shelters microorganisms\nfrom environmental stresses such as temperature, osmotic, and pH changes, carbon and/or nitrogen\nstarvation. Seeking inhibitors against bacterial DnaK chaperone systems will lead to a new\ndirection for the development of antimicrobial agents, as current antimicrobial compounds have\nshown fewer efficacies due to the rapid emergence of resistant strains involving both Gram-positive\nand Gram-negative pathogens. \n\nAn in vitro refolding assay was developed by Chaperone Technologies to detect and quantify the\nactivity of DnaK. Firefly luciferase was chemically denatured and used as a substrate for the\nchaperone system. Luminescence readout was then used to detect the refolding of luciferase enzyme.\nThe Emory Center has optimized and adapted the assay to a 384-well format for HTS and was able to\nconsistently achieve a signal to noise ratio of above 8 and a Z prime factor of above 0.5. \nPositive compounds from the screening assay, AID 547, were chosen for follow-up in this\ndose-response screen.\n\nEscherichia coli DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE proteins were purchased commercially through Assay Designs\n(Ann Arbor, Michigan), Luciferase enzyme was from Sigma. Promega's Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay\nSystem was used for the luminescence detection. The assay was carried out in three steps: chemical\ndenaturation of firefly luciferase, chaperone induced refolding, and detection of luciferase\nlevels. \n\n23 uM of firefly luciferase stock in glycine buffer (1 M glycine, 0.1 M of MgSO4, 0.01 M of EDTA,\npH7) was denatured in denaturing buffer containing 6 M guanidinium HCl, 30 mM Tris HCl, and 5 mM\nDTT at pH7.5 for 30min at room temperature and 60 min at 5 degrees C. Denatured luciferase was then\ndiluted to working concentration (20 nM) with cold refolding buffer plus (10 mM MOPS, 50 mM KCl, 5\nmM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT and 1 mM ATP, pH7.5).  The sample was furthered incubated at 5 degrees C for at\nleast 60 min before use. At the same time, chaperone protein mixture of DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE was\nprepared in working concentrations of 200, 100 and 400 nM, respectively, in refolding buffer (10 mM\nMOPS, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5) and incubated for at least 3 hr at room temperature.\nHTS was carried out in white, opaque bottom, 384-well polystyrene plates (Costar) with 12.5 uL of\ndenatured luciferase and 12.5 uL of chaperone protein mixture using Wellmate dispenser by Matrix\nTechnologies. For each plate, columns 1, 2 and 23, 24 contain controls: denatured luciferase only,\nrefolding buffer only, chaperone proteins only and CHP105 at 100 ug/mL as positive controls.\nCompounds (0.5 mM stock in DMSO) were then added in the appropriate concentration to assay plates\nusing Caliper's Sciclone liquid handler. In order to rule out compound induced refolding, a\nseparate set of plates with only denatured luciferase plus compounds were set up parallel with the\nassay. All plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 3 hr. The luciferase activity\nwas measured by adding 25 uL of diluted Steady-Glo (18.75 uL of refolding buffer, 6.25uL of\nSteady-Glo) before reading with Perkin Elmer's Envision.\nAll data were normalized to plate controls using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the\nUniversity of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral\nphenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the\npiperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring\nother heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with\npiperidine.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Late-stage fluorescence dose response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): purchased compounds EC50.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 agonist dose response from powder samples. This assay\nuses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6;\nS1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a\nbeta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the\ncontrol of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of\nthe fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The\nliberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA\nexpression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable,\nfluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists\nwill activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point,\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth\nmedia consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM\nNEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200\nug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, 100 ug/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The\nnext day, 50 nL of test compound (50 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample\nwells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High Control\nprepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final\nconcentration of 6 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the\nincubation, 22 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. The reported\nEC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50%\ninhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50\nuM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than\n50 uM. \nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. \nCompounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of the\ncompounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-90, for inactives 12-0.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

This\nparticular assay uses BJ cell line which is derived from normal human foreskin fibroblast.\n\nThe Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7\nactivities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of\na peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is\nliberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent\nsignal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present.\nUsing the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the BJ cell\nline with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was\nperformed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, staurosporine and tamoxifen were used as\npositive controls.

Because of its role in protein folding and transport, the ER is also rich in\nCa2+-dependent molecular chaperones, such as Grp78, Grp94, and calreticulin, which help stabilize\nprotein folding intermediates.\n       This work's aim is to identify chemical compounds that inhibit cell death induced by ER\nstress using a cell-based survival assay.  Using secondary assays, selectivity of these compounds\nfor the ER stress pathway was defined, and the principal signaling events that are inhibited were\ndissected.

The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein\nsynthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that\nemployed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. \nVero cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form\nof luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the proteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits\nprotein synthesis, results in markedly diminished luciferase translation. Stx inhibitors permit\nproduction of the luciferase reporter and result in increased luminescence.\n\nSix million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2.

This assay also serves as a primary counterscreen for a previous set of experiments\nentitled, \"Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of\nRetinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)\" (AID 1515). In this biochemical assay, recombinant\nFam108B protein is incubated with test compounds and FP-Rh probe. The reaction is excited with\nlinear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value\n(mP). As designed, test compounds that act as Fam 108B inhibitors will prevent Fam 108B-probe\ninteractions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well,\nleading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 9.51 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris\nHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 0.625 micromolar of Fam108B protein were dispensed\ninto 1536 microtiter plates.\nCatalytically dead Fam108B (S170A) protein (0.625 micromolar) in Assay Buffer was dispensed to\npositive control wells. Next, 48 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.0.951% final\nconcentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees\nCelsius.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all\nwells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius,\nfluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland)\nusing a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission =\n598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and\nperpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer\nViewlux software.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )\nWhere:\nLow_Control is defined as the median value of all test compound wells.\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing Fam 108B in the presence of test compound.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing catalytically dead Fam 108B (S170A) protein in the\npresence of DMSO.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-11, for inactive 11-0.\nList of Reagents:\nRecombinant Fam108B (supplied by Assay Provider)\nRecombinant Fam108B (S170A) (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFP-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider)\nTris HCl (Sigma, part T3038)\nNaCl (Sigma, part S6546)\nPluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176)\nDTT (Invitrogen, part 15508-013)\n" ;

Until\nrecently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1\nselective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which\nprohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1\nPAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all\nallosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse\nchemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS.\nCHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM)\nfor 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS\n(Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All\ncompounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was\nthen added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine (ACh) submax\nconcentration (~EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to\nassay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular\nDevices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test\ncompound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were\nthen stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (~EC20).  The signal amplitude was\nfirst normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine.\nEC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using\nstandard non-linear regression (variable slope).  The percentage of ACh maximum response values\nreported represent the Prism-calculated top of the concentration-response curve for three\nreplicates analyzed together.  The M1 EC50 mean values reported represent the Prism-calculated EC50\nvalues from concentration-response curves for three replicates analyzed together.\nCompounds with mean EC50s greater than 10uM were considered inactive (0). Active compounds with\nmean EC50s from 5-10uM were assigned a score of '50' and less than 5uM were assigned a score of\n'100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Agonists\nTSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland\nwhich belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a\nseven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s)\nprotein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5'\nmonophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and\nregulates their growth and function. Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with\nthyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after\nsurgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small\nmolecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and\nphysiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings. However, no selective small\nmolecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has\never been reported.\nA confirmatory assay of putative TSHR agonists was conducted on a HEK 293 cell line stably\nexpressing the TSHR, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: an ELISA\nbased cAMP competition assay using cAMP-Screen Direct System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City ,\nCA).\n\nHEK 293 cells expressing TSHR were cultured for 24 h before incubation for 1 h in serum-free DMEM\ncontaining 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (SIGMA) and small molecule ligands in a\nhumidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37C. Following aspiration of the medium, cells were lysed using\nlysis buffer of the cAMP-Screen DirectTM System (Applied Biosystems). The cAMP content of the cell\nlysate was determined using the method described in the manufacturer#s protocol. An enzyme\nsubstrate with a luminescent enhancer generates glow light emission kinetics. Light signal\nintensity, which is inversely proportional to the cAMP level in the sample, is measured in a\nluminometer (Perkin Elmer, 1420 Multilabel, Victor 3) for 3 seconds/well 30 min after substrate\naddition. Potencies (i.e., EC50) of the ligands were obtained from dose-response curves by data\nanalysis with GraphPad Prism 4 software for Windows.\n" ;

This assay also serves as a\ncounterscreen for a recent set of experiments entitled, \"Dose Response Cell-Based Assay for\nAgonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3): Purchased Analogues\" (PubChem AID 1192).\nIn this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P1 (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and the beta-lactamase (BLA)\nreporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1\nagonism by test compound.  Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor\nfamily, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. \nThrough stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases production of cAMP and therefore\ntranscription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene, as measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate.  S1P1\nagonists would abrogate this effect.  As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P1 agonist will\nincrease S1P1 activity, inhibit BLA transcription, leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds\nwere tested in quadruplicate in 384-well plates using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a\nnominal test concentration of 10 uM.\n\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2\nmg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the\nassay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.3 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM\nsupplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no\nantibiotics. \nThe assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension (3000 cells) to each well, followed by\nincubation for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2.  Then 10 nL of test compound or DMSO control was\nadded. One ul of forskolin (2 uM final concentration) was dispensed to test and negative control\nwells. Additionally, 1.1 ul of SEW2871 (1 uM final concentration) was added to designated positive\ncontrol wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2.2\nul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol and containing 15 mM probenecid, was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room\ntemperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences,\nTurku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460\nnm.  \nTo normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were\nused to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I590 nm/I460 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: \n% Activation = 100*[1 - ((Ratio_Test_Compound -Median_Ratio_Positive_Control) /\nabs(Median_Ratio_Positive_Control - Median_Ratio_Negative_Control))\nWhere:\nTest compound is defined as wells containing test compound and forskolin\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing forskolin\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing SEW2871 and forskolin\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was\nfitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases\nwhere the highest concentration tested (10 uM) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was\ndetermined manually as > 10 uM.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were\nconsidered inactive.  Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered\nactive. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 uM\nand as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 uM.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero.

This\nparticular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-006) purchased from Coriell Institute\nfor Medical Research.\n\nThe CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the\nnumber of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a\nhigh-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR.  The assay was\nperformed in a \"duplex\" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat\nBasophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1.  The FPR-expressing\ncells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the\nFPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the\nlysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that\nbound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to\nFPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the\nfluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.\n\nThe primary HTS FPRL1 counter-screen assay was performed in 384 well format.  Test compounds were\nassessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand\nbinding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from\nFPRL1.  \nThe FPR primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported\nseparately.  The results of the present report represent counter-screen data with which to\ndetermine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in the\nprimary HTS assay report.\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines \n(10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well).  After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).   fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide.  \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\nTest compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as:\n%Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)]\nin which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells\ncontaining test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of\ncells in negative control wells, respectively.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. \nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. \nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\n\nMembranes were prepared from M5-CHO cells according to a previously described protocol.\nBinding reactions contained 0.09 nM\n[3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) (obtained commercially from Amersham), 15-20 ug of membrane\nprotein, and test compound or atropine in a total volume of 500 ul assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM\nMgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4).  1 uM (final) atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. \nThe KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.264 nM.  Binding reactions were incubated for\n2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (750 rpm).  Reactions\nwere stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore\nsize) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9%\nNaCl, pH 7.4).  Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount\nscintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  True [3H]-NMS concentration was\nback-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS used in the reaction.  Atropine Ki\ndetermined to be 0.21 by Cheng-Prusoff equation.  For all assays, radioligand depletion was kept to\napproximately 10% or less.\nThe compound did not compete with[3H]-NMS and was inactive in this assay. The 'Outcome' was\nassigned as 'Inactive' and the 'Score' was assigned as '0'.\n" ;

As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium\nmobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased\nwell fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors.

Next, 2\nuL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus\n(prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1\nhour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to\nthe appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room\ntemperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470 - 495 nm excitation and 515 -\n575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO\n(EC84 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells.

The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.8 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.8 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive.

RORA is a nuclear receptor that does not share significant structural homology with\nSF-1 at the ligand-binding domain. \nThis counterscreen employs the same format as the assay used to select potential SF-1 inhibitors;\nexcept that here the biological target is RORA. A compound that appears as an inhibitor in both the\nSF-1 and RORA assays would be less desirable for follow-up, since the compound may be a\nnon-selective inhibitor or format-specific artifact. On the other hand, compounds found inactive in\nthis assay and confirmed active in SF-1 dose-response experiments are likely to be selective\ninhibitors of SF-1.\n\nThis dose-response counterscreen assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast\ntranscriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor RORA (encoded by the\npFA-hRORA plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4\nresponse elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene). Both pFA-hRORA and pG5-luc plasmids\nare transiently co-transfected in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The presence in this cell\nline of required co-activators allows the expression of luciferase driven by activated RORA nuclear\nreceptors. Compounds that inhibit the basal transcription of luciferase are detected through the\nsuppression of light emission using the SteadyLite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer). Such\ncompounds hence constitute false-positives inhibitors of the SF-1 nuclear receptor.\nThree hundred and fifty nine (359) compounds selected during the primary screen were assessed in\nthis dose-response experiment in 10 point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 100 micromolar.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions.\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS16 that value had been determined to be 30 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is\na luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from\nDiscoveRx.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nidentification of small molecule antagonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1778) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\n\nThe purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M1 receptor for\ntheir ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding.\nExperimental Protocol:\nMembranes were prepared from M1-expressing CHO cells as described [1]. Binding reactions contained\n0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 micrograms of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define\ntotal binding) or 1 micromolar atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500\nmicroliters. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially\ndiluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to\ngive a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated\nfor 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions\nwere stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1micrometer\npore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl,\n0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount\nscintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity\nexperiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and\npresence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30 micromolar, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS\nconcentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction.\nRadioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less.\n1.

PMID: 18059262\nData Fitting:\nData from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum\nspecific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and\nfitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no\nweighting. Log10 values of each compound concentration are reported. Atropine was used to determine\nnon-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a  full sigmoidal\ndose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score'\nwas assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'\n" ;

This assay also serves as\na counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based cell-based primary\nhigh throughput screening assay to identify positive allosteric modulators of the human M1\nmuscarinic receptor (CHRM1)\" (AID 588819).\nThis assay uses ATP as the agonist. In this assay, parental CHO-K1 cells are loaded with the Fluo-8\nfluorogenic calcium indicator dye for 60 min at 37 C, followed by addition of test compounds, a\nbasal read, addition of ATP (EC20), and measurement of well fluorescence. As designed, a compound\nthat non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will lead to increased\nfluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in\nsinglicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity\n(RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v\nheat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and\nstreptomycin).\nThe day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well\nmicrotiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL\nof the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5%\nCO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test\ncompound in DMSO were transferred to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal\nread of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the\nFLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of ATP.\nThen a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds\nof the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nThe percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing ATP at EC20 and DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck\ncounterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation\nof test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values\nwas used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %\nactivation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation.\nNegative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-54, and for inactive compounds 53-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCell line: Parental CHOK1 cell line (Conn Lab)\nCalcium sensitive dye: Fluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit; (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nGrowth media: Ham's F-12; 10% FBS, 20mM HEPES\nAssay media: Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES\nAssay plates: Aurora black/clear 1536well FLIPR plate; (Aurora, part 00019326)\nProbenecid: 250mM (pH 8.0); (Sigma P8761)\nPotentiator: ATP (50mM stock in water); Sigma A9187\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The full-length NS3 peptide sequence in West Nile and Dengue viruses represents a multifunctional\nprotein. The N-terminal 184 amino acid-long fragment of NS3 represents the NS3 proteinase. The\nC-terminal portion of the NS3 protein encodes a nucleotide triphosphatase, an RNA triphosphatase\nand a helicase. The NS3 proteinase is required for the maturation of the virus. The NS3 proteinase\nis responsible for cleaving the NS2a/NS2b, NS2b/NS3, NS3/NS4a and NS4b/NS5 junction regions. This\nproteinase is also responsible for the cleavage at the C-terminal region of the C protein. As is\nthe case with a number of flaviviruses, the NS2b protein, that is located in the polypeptide\nprecursor upstream of the NS3 proteinase, functions as a cofactor and promotes the proteolytic\nactivity of the NS3 enzyme. The cofactor activity of the 40 amino acid long central portion of the\nNS2b is roughly equivalent to that of the entire NS2b sequence. Most importantly, inactivating\nmutations of the NS3 cleavage sites in the polyprotein precursor abolish virus infectivity. We\nhypothesize that the processing NS3 proteinase, which is an essential component of the virus life\ncycle, is the most promising drug target for anti-flaviviral inhibitors, from which novel,\nanti-viral therapies will emerge.\n\nNS2bNS3 HTS Assay Protocol.\nAprotinin, Sigma, A-4529.\nBrij-35 solution, 30%, Sigma, B4184-1L                                                   \nDimethylsulfoxide, (DMSO) Sigma, 154938.\nGlycerol, Sigma, G5516-1L.\nPyr-RTKR-AMC Substrate, BaChem  I-1650.\nTris Base, Molecular Biology Grade, EMD Biosciences, 648310.\nConsumables  \n384-well black low-volume assay plate, Greiner 784076.\n384-well low profile pyramid bottom reservoir, Innovative Microplate                 S30022\nPK384 Robotic Tip series, 30uL Axygen, PK-384-R\nPreparation of Stock Solutions:\nAprotinin, 1 mM: To make 1 mM Aprotinin dissolve 6.51 mg Aprotinin in 1 mL 20% glycerol.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel\ntherapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the\nintersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby\noffering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest,\nsince they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly\nactivate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nThe NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific\nmotifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce\nactivation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a\ngeneral bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria\n(S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M.\ntuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).\n Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in\ncells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing\nconvenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells.\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved\nin inflammatory responses. Apart of being a prototypical NF-kappaB target gene, recent studies have\nindicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7\nover-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8\nsecretion (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007).\nThe assay described below uses tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a canonical NF-kB inducer,\nand is designed for identification of hits specific to TNFa-modulated pathways. We utilized this\nassay to assess selectivity of hits emerging from  the  NOD1- specific assay, \"SAR analysis of\nGM-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD1 cells\" (AID 2250) and NOD2- specific assay, \"SAR\nanalysis of Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD2 cells\"(AID 2260) using\nIL-8.\n\nProtocol:  \n1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1\n2. TNF-alpha (Sigma)\n3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)\n4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices)\nProtocol:\n1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added\ninto respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations.\n2. TNF-alpha was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ng/ml, to a culture medium suspension of\nMCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter).\n3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC\n(5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours.\n4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit\nfrom BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences)\nwere coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium\ncarbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer\n(PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room\ntemperature for 1 h.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold.\nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19.\nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS16 that value had been determined to be 30 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

This\nparticular assay uses the NIH 3T3 cell line which is derived from mouse fibroblasts.\n\nThe Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7\nactivities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of\na peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is\nliberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent\nsignal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present.\nUsing the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the NIH 3T3\ncell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was\nperformed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as\npositive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of\ncaspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only)\nand 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response\ndata modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in previous\nexperiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y2,\" (PubChem AID 1359), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of\nNPY-Y2\" (PubChem AID 1539) were nonselective due to agonism of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line\ntransfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism\nof the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with\nisoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity\nalso change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed,\na test compound that acts as an agonist of Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP\nlevels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well\nfluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1\nHEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each\nwell of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates\nwere incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing\n2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated\nat room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was\nperformed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices),\nthen 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL\nof test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate\nwells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge\nwith 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the\nphosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then\nincubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the\nsame instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells\ncontaining only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these\ntwo values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation\nthan the cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation\nvalue. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 16 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 16 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no published patents or studies specifically describing small molecule\nantagonists of the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand\nfor the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the\nchemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a\nrole at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells,\nand dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a\nrecent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal\nliver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in\nprimary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the\nmetastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation\nof the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases\nincluding hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis.\nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as\n'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important\nobjective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer\nmetastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis. \nIn this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor\nresulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.\nThe goal of this assay is to validate hits obtained in \"uHTS identification of small molecule\nantagonists of the CCR6 receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 493098 and to study\nthe structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits.

Thus identification of\ncompounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. \nGPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in\naddiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  The goal of this project is to\nidentify small molecule antagonists of GPR35, which may aid in characterization of this receptor\nand ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR35 in addictive behavior.\nThis high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and the GPR35 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP\nredistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to clathrin-coated pits, which\ncan be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins.  When this receptor is\nblocked by an antagonist, this arrestin-GFP redistribution is inhibited and can be detected as a\ndecrease in local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins as compared to the agonist activity.  \nAssay Materials:\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10mM Hepes, and\nselection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution: 2.0% DMSO diluted in PBS\n5) Agonist Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis # ALX-430-020-M010 - 10mg, 5mM stock in DMSO)\ndiluted in PBS to 100uM \n6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer\n(10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nPrimary Screen Procedure:\n1) 45ul of cell suspension (133,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates were incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3)   Serum was removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition\nof compounds.  \n4) Compound addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman):\na) 5ul of 100uM compound solution was added to columns 3 through 24 of the assay plates for a final\nassay compound concentration of 10uM and 0.5% DMSO.  \nb) 5ul of 5% DMSO was added to columns 1 and 2 to balance the volume and DMSO concentration across\nthe plate.\nc) 5ul of positive control (2% DMSO) working solution was added to column 1. \n5) Plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.\n6) Agonist addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman):  \na) 5ul of agonist (100uM Zaprinast) working solution was added to columns 2-24.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The protein-protein interaction between the subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF,\ncore binding factor b (CBFb) and Runx1 (CBFa), plays a critical role in hematopoiesis. Chromosomal\nrearrangements that target the core-binding factor genes are some of the most common mutations in\nleukemia. RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(3;21)(q26;q22),\nt(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;q22),\nt(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with myeloid and\nlymphocytic leukemia. The gene coding for the CBFb subunit (CBFB) is also the target of a common\nchromosomal translocation, inv(16).\nThe role of CBFb binding for the (dys)function of AML1-ETO, product of the t(8;21) mutation, was\nrecently examined. The introduction of point mutations into the Runt domain in AML1-ETO which\nabrogates CBFb binding 400-fold results in loss of the ability to immortalize lin- BM cells as well\nas a loss of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of AML1-ETO leukemia. These results validate this\nprotein-protein interaction as an appropriate target for the development of a small molecule\ninhibitor which may have therapeutic usefulness for appropriate forms of leukemia.\nThe purpose of this assay to use HTS to identify inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction\nbetween the RUNX1 Runt domain and CBFb. This is accomplished by using a fluorescence resonance\nenergy transfer (FRET) assay.  When added together Cerulean-Runt domain and Venus-CBFb will bind\nand allow for energy transfer.  If an inhibitor is present, binding will not occur and the FRET\nsignal will be abated.  This assay can be a counterscreen for AID:1434.\nAssay materials:\n1) Cerulean-Runt domain, Venus-CBFb and unlabeled-CBFb was provided by Dr. John Bushweller\n(University of Virginia Charlottesville, Charlottesville VA).  \nuHTS protocol:\n1) The protein complex (PC); 100nM Cerulean-Runt domain, 100nM Venus-CBFb in 50mM Tris pH7.5, 100mM\nKCl, 10mM K2SO4, 2mM Mg2SO4, and 0.01% BSA is incubated in the dark at room temperature.\n2) After 1 hour 4ul of PC is dispensed into columns 3 through 48 of a black 1536 well plate\n(Corning #3724)\n3) 4ul of positive control (PC + 5uM unlabeled CBFb) is added to the wells in columns 1 and 2.\n4) 40nl of 100% DMSO is added to wells in columns 1 through 4, while 40nl of 2mM compounds in 100%\nDMSO is added to wells in columns  5 through 48.  Final compound concentration is 20uM, final DMSO\nconcentration is 1%.\n5) The plate is incubated for 1 hr at room temperature protected from light.\n6) After 1 hour the plate is read on a BMG Pherastar 422ex, 530em and 480em\n7) Raw values are the ratio of 530/480 signals.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous\nsystem resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2): Cell-based high\nthroughput assay to measure NPY-Y1 antagonism.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of\nneuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2),\" (PubChem AID 793) were nonselective antagonists due to\ninhibition of the Y1 receptor.\nA cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were\nused to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\nTo measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units. As designed, test compounds that increase probe fluorescence in Y1 cells are\nconsidered non-selective antagonists. Compounds were tested in triplicate.\n\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nPrior to the start of the assay, 3,600 Y1 cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth\nmedia as above but without Geneticin and Puromycin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well\nblack clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24\nhours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per\nwell of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room\ntemperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed\n(510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the\ncells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (25 nM final nominal concentration; NPY's EC95) in\nPBS. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final\nconcentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for\n60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing\nisoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; isoproterenol's EC100) and the phosphodiesterase\ninhibitor, Ro 20-1724 (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS. The plates were then incubated\nfor 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same\ninstrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as\nfollows:\n% Inhibition = [1-((RatioTest_Compound - Median Ratio High_Control)/ (Median Ratio Low_Control -\nMedian Ratio High_Control))]*100\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nLowControl is defined as wells with DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHighControl is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol.\nAny compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated\nfor the Primary screen was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized\nto 100% of the highest observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity\nscore zero.\nList of reagents:\nY1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled \"S1P3 Agonist Primary\nHTS and Confirmation Assays\" were selected for testing in this assay. Further information on the\nprevious set of experiments can be found by searching on this website for PubChem AID = 373.  \nA cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene\nunder control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3\nagonism. If the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene\noccurred via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was\nproportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA\nsubstrate.\n\nIn this experiment, 69 compounds that passed hit selection criteria were tested to determine\nindividual EC50 values. The compounds were \"hit-picked\" at a 10 millimolar in DMSO and further\nserially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound\nconcentrations.\n\nThe assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in\ntriplicate. S1P was used as the positive control. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate\nbasis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar S1P (i.e. 100% activation). In\nthis assay, S1P had a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of approximately 200 nM.\nDose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal\nconcentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The\nreported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50%\nactivity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (45 micromolar) did\nnot result in > 50% inhibition, the EC50 was determined manually as > 45 micromolar. Compounds with\nEC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to\nless than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50\nfor samples with EC50 of less than 45 micromolar and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or\nequal to 45 micromolar.\n\nThe assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate.

This\nparticular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-020) purchased from Coriell Institute\nfor Medical Research.\n\nThe CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the\nnumber of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide).

RUNX1 (AML1) is disrupted by the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22),\nt(3;21)(q26;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22),\nt(14;21)(q22;q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), all of which are associated with\nmyeloid and lymphocytic leukemia.

This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand\nbinding domain (LBD) of ER-beta labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a\nlong-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with LBD or ER-beta brings europium and\nCy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation.  Compounds that interfere with the FRET\nsignal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand\nantagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by\nvarious counter-screening assays.\nCompounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 633 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-beta\nCoactivator Binding Inhibitors, were selected for testing in this assay.  Each compound was tested\nin 6 concentration, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar.\n Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  \n\n1.

SRC-Cy5 peptide \n6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide\nProcedure:\n1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-beta protein (0.3 nM, final\nconcentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final\nconcentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). \n2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate.\n3. Add library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2\nhr. \n4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330\nnm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm.\nData analysis:\n1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios:\nFRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000\n2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is\ncalculated with the following equation based on data from each plate.\n% of Inhibition = 100 - ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) *\n100\nWhere FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an\naverage FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET\nratio from wells containing Eu-ER-beta protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. \nFor each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using BioAssay software\nfrom CambridgeSoft.  The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for\nX-intercept at the 50% level of Y-intercept.  \nWhen the highest concentration tested (50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50%\ninhibition, the IC50 is reported as greater than 50 micromolar.  \nSimilarly, when the lowest concentration tested (1.5625 micromolar) resulted in greater than 50%\ninhibition, the IC50 is reported as less than 1.5625 micromolar.\nCompounds with IC50 values of greater than 30 uM were considered inactive, compounds with an IC50\nequal or less than 30 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on the observed range of the IC50 values obtained,\naccording to the following formula:\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - ((IC50 - LowestIC50) / (HighestIC50 - LowestIC50)))\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay\n\nThe Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase\nsignaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell\nsurface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by\nthe small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs.\nAlternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for\nhigh-throughput screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays\nconsisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of\ntarget for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The\ncompounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR\nmutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of\nthe prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other\nimportant ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1.\n\nThe HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR\nmutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled\nstreptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the\nsubstrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in\nhomogenous assay format.\nMEK protein was obtained\nfrom Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 %\nNaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate.\nThe HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit.

This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the\nGPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4\nmigrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic,\ncell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate\nS1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration\nof 5 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).

The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or\nS1P (5 uM final concentration) prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA, was added to the appropriate\nwells.

To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nActivation =100* ((Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing S1P.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the screen. Two\nvalues were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound\nwells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a\ncutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that\nparticular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation\nvalue.

As\ndesigned, test compounds that inhibit STAT3 activity are considered non-selective inhibitors.\nCompounds were tested in triplicate.\n\nThe inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run\nsimultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin\nand streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell\nsuspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was\nstarted by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in\nDMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (100 uM final nominal\nconcentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final\nconcentration; set as 0% inhibition). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5%\nCO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed\ninto sample and all control wells. This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80%\nSTAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5%\nCO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at\nroom temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.\nLuminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.\n" ;

The different bead sets, acquired from Duke\nScientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied\nmagnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are\nlocated in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. \n\nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. \nFlow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence\nemission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The\nresulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine\nthe compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated\nwith different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. \nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a\nwell.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. \nCompounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned\na PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RasWT there are only 63\nmissing compounds.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT) and the results from a fluorescent compound is considered to be\n'inconclusive' (PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 3, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0).  Assessment of\nfluorescent compound is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on all the\nproteins in one well.  Difference between Sample fluorescence and Positive Control fluorescence are\ncalculated for all the different proteins in a well.  The following equation describes this\ndifference (CompoundFLinRacWT) for RacWT;\nCompoundFLinRacWT = RacWTSampleFL - PCntrlRacWTFL \nwith RacWTSampleFL being the Sample fluorescence and PCntrlRacWTFL the Positive Control\nfluorescence of RacWT coated beads. Next, the coefficient of variation (CV) of all these CompoundFL\nfrom the different protein beads (RacWT, Rab7, RacACT, RasWT, Rab2, Cdc) in the same well are\ncalculated.  If the CV was less than 30%, meaning the compound attributed fluorescence was very\nsimilar between all the different proteins, then the compound was flagged as a potential\nfluorescent compound.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RasWT there are only 4,084 fluorescent\ncompounds.\nDue to potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends),\nnormalization is utilized to calculate the percent activity of the test compound.  Whole plate\ntrends of the positive controls are evaluated by linear regression.

The\nfusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST\nEuropium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. \nCompounds that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two\nentities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies.  As designed, a compound\nthat acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride,\n100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.

After excitation\nat 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux\nmicroplate reader (Perkin Elmer). \nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical\nexpression:\nRatio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl)) \nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80\nmicromolar. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an EC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a\nhigh-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a \"duplex\"\nformat in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL)\ncell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a\nred-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells\nduring flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the\npeptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with\nhigh affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were\ndetermined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the\nduplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. \n\nThe FPRL1 dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported\nseparately and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and\nspecificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPR binding\nresults reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and\nspecificity of compounds identified to have FPRL1 binding activity in the FPRL1 dose-response assay\nreport.\n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\n\nKi determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in\nthe dose response assay. Test compounds with Ki less than 10 microM were scored as active and all\nothers as inactive." ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and\nplay important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems.\nOf these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic\ntargets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of\ncholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs.\nDue to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the\nmAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been\nlargely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been\nimpossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a\nM1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and\nan antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like\nprofile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the\nantipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of\nM1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion\nthat a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide\nantipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by\nrecent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and\ndopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine \nhyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered\nhippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide\na novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1\nmay also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the\nrelative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or\nantipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly\nselective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it\nimpossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.\nAssay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye\n(2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate\nvolume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM\nHEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X stock\nconcentration (30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay\nplate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine CRC serial dilutions were prepared at\na 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was\nmeasured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the\nfollowing protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to\nthe addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a one of\neight concentrations of the Acetylcholine CRC.  The signal amplitude was first normalized to\nbaseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for the\nAcetylcholine CRC alone (i.e. plus Vehicle) and in the presence of a fixed high concentration (30\nuM final concentration) of each test compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which\nfit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope).  The degree of potentiation or\nfoldshift of the ACh CRC induced by the test compound was calculated by dividing the EC50 for ACh\nplus vehicle by the EC50 for ACh in the presence of test compound. Foldshift values less than 3\nwere considered 'Inactive' with a 'Score' of '0'. Foldshift values of greater than 3 were assigned\nas 'Active.' For values of 3-30, a 'Score' of '50' was assigned and for values greater than 30 a\n'Score' of '100' was assigned.\n" ;

Deficiency\nof this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe\ndisease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes\nand cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within\nlysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that\nwere purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single\nparticular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated\nagainst different GTPase targets.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Agonists\nTSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland\nwhich belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a\nseven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s)\nprotein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5'\nmonophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and\nregulates their growth and function. Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with\nthyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after\nsurgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small\nmolecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and\nphysiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings. However, no selective small\nmolecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has\never been reported.\nIn order to confirm specificity of the compounds to the TSHR, a  confirmatory assay was conducted\non a similar family member, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) receptor, transfected into a HEK\n293 cell line, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: antibody-based\nHomogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF). This line did not contain the CNG and was therefore\nincapable of being used in the primary assay format. \n\nHomogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) cAMP Assay.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no published patents or studies specifically describing small molecule\nantagonists of the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand\nfor the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the\nchemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a\nrole at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells,\nand dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a\nrecent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal\nliver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in\nprimary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the\nmetastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation\nof the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases\nincluding hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis.\nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as\n'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important\nobjective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer\nmetastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis. \nIn this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor\nresulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.\n\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based cAMP assay. NPS can stimulate the\nproduction of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in\nintracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET\n(time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled\nwith Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer\nand the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating\na TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The\nnative unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding\nand reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled\nmolecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be\ndetected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620\nnm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing. This assay was\nsuccessfully optimized to a 1536-well plate format.\nSelect compounds from the primary screen (AID 1461) were chosen for confirmation based on potency,\nefficacy, SAR, and activity across other assays in PubChem and at NCGC. Other compounds are analogs\nof active compounds from the primary sceen.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained\nfrom Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both\nthe ratio of the two emission wavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620.\nData were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS\ncontrol). IC50 values were determined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard\nHill equation.\nNPS 1536-well assay protocol:\n(1) Fresh or frozen CHO-NPSR cells were suspended in F-12 Kaighn's media supplemented with 10 %\nFBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 4 ul/well (1200\ncells) to white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16\nto 30 hours.\n(2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution.

Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors. \nThe present assay uses an alternate technology to confirm hits from the primary screen -\nhomogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF).\nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in previous\nexperiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y2,\" (PubChem AID 1359), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of\nNPY-Y2\" (PubChem AID 1539) act as agonists of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with\nY2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y2\nreceptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with\nisoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity\nalso change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed,\na test compound that acts as an agonist of Y2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP\nlevels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well\nfluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic\nmix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG\ncells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well\nof 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were\nincubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2\nmicroliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added\nto the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells\ncontaining only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these\ntwo values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation\nthan the cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation\nvalue. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 9 and active compounds range\nof activity score is 9 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344870)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses) are important human and/or animal pathogens that cause acute\nvirus infections with severe diseases and/or death. Several recent human and/or animal epidemics\nhave been caused by arboviruses, including Dengue virus (DNV) in South America and Asia, West Nile\nvirus (WNV) in North America and Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe.  Commercially available vaccines\nare not available for many arboviruses and those that are available are frequently not 100%\nefficacious.  For example, there is no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against\nWNV, which is spreading across the US.  The commercial Dengue vaccine has been under development\nfor decades and still is not effective against all strains of Dengue viruses.  This was recently\nseen when a new strain of Dengue III spread through South America causing sever disease and death. \n So for many arbovirus based diseases, there is no effective vaccine or chemotherapy currently\navailable.  The need to develop antiviral drugs is critical in treating and managing disease.  BTV\nwas selected as a prototype virus from this genus for use in developing a High Throughput Screening\nprotocol.  It was selected because it is not pathogenic in humans, which reduces the risk\nassociated with assay development using infectious agents.  \nTo screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format.  The assay\nmeasures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in BSR cells by BTV infection using cell viability as the\nend point.   The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by BTV infection involves challenging 5000\ncells with BTV virus at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The BTV-10\nvirus stock was prepared on July 10, 2007 from BSR cells. The assay includes both cell and virus\ncontrols and cell survival was measured 72 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability\nreagent (Promega). Cell viability was determined from intracellular ATP concentration using firefly\nluciferase as the reporter. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values\nof the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x\n100. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. \nCell Culture: BSR cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5% FBS. The cells are\nmaintained at 37OC, 5.0% CO2 to 90% confluence. Prior to cell plating, cells were re-suspended in\nDMEM with 100ug/L streptomycin, 100 IU Penicillin/L, 4mM L-glut and 1% FBS (Assay Media). \nBTV virus culture: The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared in BSR cells using a stock available in Dr.\nQianjun Li's laboratory. Briefly, BSR cells were grown in four T75 plates to 90% confluence, and\n5ml of BTV-10 virus at 105pfu/ml was then added to the culture media. After three days incubation,\ncells and the supernatant were harvested and the cells were pelleted.  The cell pellet was\nre-suspended in 20 ml media, and sonicated. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10\nminutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80 OC. These virus stocks\nwere titrated in BSR cells using the TCID50 method. The titer was 1 X 108 TCID50/ml. \nControl and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and\n5ul was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue\nculture treated plates.  Test compounds were diluted in media to 60uM with a DMSO concentration of\n0.6%.  5ul was also dispensed to the assay plate.\n  \nCell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 5000 cells/well\nwere plated in 15uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were then transferred to the Virology HTS lab\nand incubated 2-4 hrs at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity.\nVirus Addition: BTV was diluted in media to 5,000 pfu/ml and 10ul was added to the compound wells\nand the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.01).  Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell\ncontrol wells.  All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety\nCabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated for 72 h within the BSL-2\nlaboratory.\nEndpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an\nequal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well.  Plates were incubated\nfor 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision\nmulti-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-2\nfacility. \n" ;

This\nparticular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP1-002) purchased from Coriell Institute\nfor Medical Research.\n\nThe CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the\nnumber of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 40\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease that currently affects over 200 million.  It\nis caused by different species of flatworms, such as Schistosoma mansoni.  Over the last century,\ndrugs to treat the disease have evolved from potassium antimonyl tartrate, artemisinin,\noxamniquine, to praziquantel, with praziquantel remaining the universally-used single drug of\nchoice over the past three decades.  However, transmission rates have changed little with\npraziquantel, and there is evidence for the development of drug resistant parasites.  Because there\nis currently no suitable alternative therapy available, there is an urgent need to identify new\ntargets and drugs for schistosomiasis treatment.  Thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), one\nuniquely positioned S. mansoni enzyme, has been identified as a major component of the worms'\ndistinct and compressed antioxidant \"firewall\".  TGR is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the\ninterconversion between reduced and oxidized forms of both glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxins, thus\nmaking it an attractive new antiparasitic target.  \nRecently, a quantitative high-throughput screen of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule\nRepository (MLSMR, ~71K at the time of the screen in 2007) was performed using an assay that\ntargeted both TGR and peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2, an H2O2-reducing enzymatic component of the S. mansoni\nredox \"firewall\") by following the decrease of NADPH fluorescence.  The screen led to the\nidentification of furoxan (4-phenyl-3-furoxancarbonitrile, PubChem CID 1756) (oxadiazole-2-oxide\nclass) that acted as a TGR inhibitor and later was shown to possess potent ex vivo worm killing\nability at modest concentrations (10 uM) and against all developmental stages of worm.  Additional\nmechanistic link between exogenous NO donation and parasitic injury for the oxadiazole-2-oxide\nclass of compounds was also expanded and better defined.  Although the screen addressed both TGR\nand Prx2, the assay required post-screen target deconvolution for further characterization of the\nactives.  In addition, the fluorescence assay was also subject to fluorescence interference from\ncompound library members.  \nWe have developed a 1536-well-based kinetic HTS assay to address TGR alone.  The assay followed the\nreduction of 5, 5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Ellman's reagent) by NADPH and measured\nthe increase in absorbance at 412 nm of the reaction product, TNB.  Furoxan inhibition that was\nobserved in the screening assay was recapitulated in this miniaturized absorbance assay;\nfurthermore, concentration-response curves of furoxan were almost identical upon separate testing,\nwith IC50s falling within the 4.0-7.9 uM range.  This assay format can be used to screen the\ncurrent MLSMR collection (with >300K compounds available) to find novel TGR inhibitors.  Furoxan is\na good choice to serve as a positive control in the primary HTS assay. \nThree microliters of reagents (100 uM NADPH and 20 nM TGR or 100 uM NADPH as no-enzyme control)\nwere dispensed into 1,536-well black clear-bottomed plates.  Compounds (23 nL) were transferred via\nKalypsys pin tool equipped with 1536-pin array (10 nL slotted pins, V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA).\n The plates were then be incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and 1 uL aliquot of 500 uM NADPH\nwere added, immediately followed by a 1 uL aliquot of 15 mM DTNB to start the reaction.  The plate\nwas transferred to a ViewLux high-throughput CCD imager (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) where kinetic\nmeasurements of the TNB absorbance were acquired using a 405 excitation filter.  Throughout the\nscreen, reagent bottles and all liquid lines were made light-tight to minimize reagent degradation.\n All screening operations were performed on a fully integrated robotic system (Kalypsys, San Diego,\nCA) containing one RX-130 and two RX-90 anthropomorphic robotic arms (Staubli, Duncan, SC). \nLibrary plates were screened starting from the lowest and proceeding to the highest concentration,\nand a \"double-dipping\" step of the highest concentration was required to access higher\nconcentrations of compounds.  Vehicle-only plates, with DMSO being pin-transferred to the entire\ncolumn 5-48 compound area, were inserted uniformly at the beginning and the end of each library in\norder to monitor for and record any shifts in the background, which can be affected by reagent\ndispensers or loss in enzyme activity overtime.  Screening data were corrected, normalized, and\nconcentration-effect relationships will be derived by using publicly-available curve fitting\nalgorithms developed in-house (http://ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts).  A four parameter Hill equation\nwas fitted to the concentration-response data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled\nand observed responses.  \n" ;

The compounds selected\nfor testing in this AID met the following criteria:  1) they were active in AID 1040; 2) they\nconfirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, \"Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay\nfor antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1),\" (PubChem AID 1254); and 3) they were\ninactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y\nreceptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism.\" (PubChem AID\n1255).\nA cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were\nused to measure receptor antagonism.  As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration. \nTo measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units.  Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series\nstarting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar.\n\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).

Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH.  The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into\nall wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours.  Following incubation,\nthe first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on\nthe FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at\nits EC95 (10 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.

The plates were then incubated\nfor 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same\ninstrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: \nRatio = (T45 / T0)\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))]*100\nWhere: \nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. \nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds\nwith an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active. \nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. \nThis image-based fluorescent beta-arrestin assay was performed to confirm hits originally\nidentified in the uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the KOR receptor.\nAssay Materials:\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the KOR receptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics\n- 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution: Dynorphin (American Peptide #24-4-50, 5mM stock in DMSO)\ndiluted in water to 10uM.  \n5) Negative Control Working Solution: 3.1% DMSO in water\n6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer\n(10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nDose Response Assay Procedure:\n1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of\ncompounds. \n4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.

CYP2C9 is an\nimportant enzyme in this superfamily in its ability to metabolize a diverse range of substrates\nincluding non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and sulfonylureas. \nThere is a growing body of the evidence that CYP isoforms have multiple compound-binding\ninteracting sites that influence the specific activity of the enzyme. A crystal structure of CYP2C9\nin the presence of warfarin demonstrated its binding in a novel allosteric site. \nCompounds activating CYP2C9 could stimulate\nmetabolism of natural substrates of the enzyme and therefore, could provide valuable tools for\ntheir characterization. \n\nIn the assay, we tested the ability of compounds from MLSMR compound\ncollection to activate the 2C9-catalyzed conversion of the substrate luciferin-H EGE to luciferin\nEGE detected using luciferase reaction.\n\nMaterials:\n1) Human 2C9 enzyme - (BD Biosciences, cat # 456258)\n2) Substrate - Luciferin-H (Promega)\n3) Luciferin detection reagent (Promega)\n4) Components of NADPH regeneration system were from Sigma-Aldrich.\n5) Negative control wells contained 0.25 mM sulfaphenazole\n6) Positive control wells contained vehicle solution\nCYP2C9 HTS protocol: \nAssay was performed in 4-uL volume using 1536-well white plates (Greiner, 782075).

Additionally, compounds\nselected for testing in this AID were not active or exhibited at least a 3-fold lower % Activation\nvalue (compared to AID 731) in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary biochemical high throughput\nscreening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by\nPPARgamma,\" (PubChem AID 631) and \"Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify\nagonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by PPARgamma,\" (PubChem AID\n1032).\nThis assay tests the ability of compounds to increase the interactions between PPARg and its\ncoactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a\nGST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-3 coactivator. The\nfusion protein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  Compounds that\npromote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities,\nallowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as\nan agonist will increase TR-FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution\nseries starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride,\n100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46\ncolumns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK,\n3 micrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of\nFLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. \nThe assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test\ncompounds, or DMSO (0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then\nincubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured.  After excitation at 340\nnm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate\nreader (Perkin Elmer). \nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical\nexpression:\nRatio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl)) \nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive.

In this assay a CHO cell line stably transfected with V1 is incubated with a\nfluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of\ntest compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds\nthat act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative\nfluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence.

This assay\nemploys the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and parental CHO-K1 cells. In\nthis assay, CHO-K1 cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1.\nCryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of Gq\nactivity. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to\nthe D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Endogenous cellular IP1 production by the CHO-K1 cells\nwill compete with labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As\ndesigned, compounds that reduce Gq activity will reduce cellular IP1 production and also reduce the\nlevels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between\nD2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET.

This assay uses\nTango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4)\nlinked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a\nbeta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the\ncontrol of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of\nthe fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The\nliberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA\nexpression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable,\nfluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists\nwill activate S1P4 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 5 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to\nsample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High\nControl prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a\nfinal concentration of 5 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After\nthe incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nActivation =100* (1-((Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/\n(Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5&#956;M S1P\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test\ncompound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used\nas a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than\nthat particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 2 and active compounds range\nof activity score is 2 to 100.\nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary\nactivation value.

        bat:hasParagraph  "TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput dose response assay to identify inhibitors of\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization.\n\nThe purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds\nidentified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"TR-FRET-based biochemical\nhigh-throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein\ndimerization\" (AID 2152). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged\nGST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST\nantibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and\nsubsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the\nEuropium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed,\ncompounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies\nand energy transfer from Europium to XL-665, leading to inhibition of well FRET. Compounds were\ntested in quadruplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration\nof 50 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM\nDTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were\ndispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with\n2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of\nFlag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5\nmicromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50%\ninhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of 10-points\nserial dilutions of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the\nappropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL\nXL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay\nplates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius.\nAt the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and\nmonitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader\n(PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were\n90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM\nGST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50%\ninhibition controls, respectively.\nTo normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to\ncalculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = ( I[671nm] / I[617nm] ) x 10,000\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of\nthree replicate wells, calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50/ greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-88, for inactive 73-0.\nList of Reagents:\nGST-core106 (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFlag-core106 (supplied by Assay Provider)\nUnlabelled core106 peptide (supplied by Assay Provider)\nAnti-Flag Antibody (XL-665 labeled) (Cisbio, part 61FG2XLB)\nAnti-GST Antibody (Europium labeled) (Cisbio, part 61GSTKLB)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789175)\nHEPES (Fisher Scientific, part BP299-500)\nEDTA (Sigma, part E7889)\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 402931)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A9647)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070)\nDTT (Sigma, part 43815)\n" ;

The dye serves to monitor\nlevels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR\npotentiators will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of\nthe indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The formylpeptide receptor (FPR) family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) contributes to the\nlocalization and activation of tissue-damaging leukocytes at sites of chronic inflammation.  FPR\nligands trigger a variety of biologic activities in myeloid cells, including chemokinesis,\nchemotaxis, cytokine production and superoxide generation.  It has been proposed that a primary FPR\nfunction is to promote trafficking of phagocytic myeloid cells to sites of infection and tissue\ndamage where they exert anti-bacterial effector functions and clear cell debris.  FPR have also\nrecently been identified in hepatocytes, immature dendritic cells, astrocytes, microglial cells,\nand the tunica media of coronary arteries.  Known FPR ligands include formylated peptides, annexin\nI (lipocortin I) and selected HIV-1 envelope proteins.  FPR have been proposed as prospective\ntargets for therapeutic intervention against malignant gliomas. \n\nA flow cytometry based high throughput screening (HTS) campaign was undertaken to identify novel\nsmall molecule FPR ligands.  A set of compounds was identified for the physical screening on the\nbasis of preliminary virtual screening of ~480,000 drug-like small molecules from Chemical\nDiversity Laboratories, Inc (San Diego, CA).  The virtual screen employed a FPR homology model\nbased on the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure and a pharmacophore based on known FPR ligands. \nThe FPR assay measured the ability of test compounds to compete with a high-affinity fluorescent\nligand, fMLFK-FITC, for binding to cell membrane FPR.\n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1st, test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2nd, U937 cells expressing transfected human FPR (107/mL, 5\nmicroL/well); 3rd, (after 30 min, 4C incubation) fMLFK-FITC (5 microL/well, Kd = 3 nM).  After an\nadditional 45 min, 4C incubation, plates are immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.  \nThe assay response range is defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled fMLFF (4Pep)\nreceptor blocking peptide or buffer.   Test compounds are assessed for the ability to inhibit\npeptide binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent\nfMLFK-FITC from FPR.  Compounds inhibiting 65% or more are considered active, subject to further\nevaluation.  The assay is homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide are added in\nsequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high\nthroughput flow cytometry platform is used to sequentially sample cells from wells (2\nmicroL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation.

NPY\nmediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors\n(GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have\nimplicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2),\nanxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling\n(6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and\ntumorigenesis (10). Due to the varied role of these receptors in human disease and physiology, the\nidentification of high affinity selective probes that target each receptor subtype may provide\nnovel tools for the study of NPY-related pathologies.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of\nprevious experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators\nor agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1304), and either \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening\nassay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1546), or \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen\nassay for potentiators of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists\nof NPY-Y1\" (AID 1697),\nand inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2\", (AID\n1359) and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (AID 1704), were nonselective due to inhibition of the parental CNGC\nactivity.\nIn this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel\n(CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of isoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by\ntest compound.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The biology of S1P receptor subtypes.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for purchased structural analogues\nof a S1P3 agonist (SID 7967985) identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled,\n\"S1P3 Agonist Dose-Response Potency Assay\" (PubChem AID 439).  In this assay, a CHO cell line\ncontaining human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear\nfactor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism by test compound. \nStimulation of S1P3 by agonist induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled\nsignaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity.  BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent\nBLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 agonist will increase well fluorescence.\n Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in 384-well plates using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting\nat a nominal test concentration of 10 micromolar.\n\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat\ninactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2\nmg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the\nassay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented\nas above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. \nThe assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight\nincubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone, or\nS1P (1 uM final nominal concentration) was added to the appropriate wells.  After 4 hours of\nincubation, 2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 6 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells.  The plates were\nthen incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.  Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. \nTo normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were\nused to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/I590 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: \n% Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control) / (Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control))*100\nWhere:\nTest compound is defined as wells containing test compound\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing S1P\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was\nfitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases\nwhere the highest concentration tested (10 uM) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was\ndetermined manually as > 10 uM.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered\ninactive.  Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. The\nactivity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 uM and as zero\nfor samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 uM.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part 15140-122)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029)\nCharcoal/dextran-treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03)\nS1P (Biomol, part SL140-0001)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part 85041)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\n384-well Plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 Flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and\nreversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel\nresearch tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal.\nA.

The compounds selected for\ntesting in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862 and AID\n1265; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high\nthroughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (AID 920); 3) they were inactive in a set\nof experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput\nassay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition\" (AID 1308); and 4) they were inactive in a set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay\nto measure STAT1 inhibition\" (AID 1317).\nIn this assay STAT1 inhibition was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line\nthat stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct.  Test compounds were screened for their\nability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated induction of STAT1::luciferase reporter activity.\nCells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in\nSTAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that\npotentiate KCNQ2 potassium channels.\n\nVoltage-gated potassium (K) channels are critical for neuronal function in excitable tissues such\nas brain and heart. They are also found in non-excitable tissues important for other functions such\nas hormone secretion, oxygen-sensing and immune responses. There are more than 100 genes in human\ngenome encoding different but homologous potassium channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels, exemplified\nby the Shaker K+ channel, share considerable sequence similarity. Isolation and characterization of\nbioactive chemical probes could form important pharmacological foundation, providing a great deal\nof insights into the structure and function. \nThe KCNQ (or also called Kv7) channel family includes five members, KCNQ1 to KCNQ5; KCNQ are\nmembers of Kv channel superfamily[1-6]. Different from other Kv channel classes, KCNQ channels\ncommonly display a sub-threshold opening (i.e., at a voltage near resting potential) and are\nregulated by GPCR signaling, e.g., muscarinic receptors [7, 8].  KCNQ2-5 channels are primarily\nexpressed in the brain, while KCNQ1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue.  Among congenital\nlong QT patients, a disease which affects 1 in 2,500 live births, the most prevalent mutations are\nwithin the KCNQ1 allele. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are known to cause benign familial neonatal\nconvulsion (BFNC), a rare form of epilepsy [9]. \nIn the mid-90s, a compound known as D-23129, or retigabine, was initially developed to target\nGABAnergic signaling [10, 11].  Despite its poor effect on the GABA pathway, retigabine was shown\nto have potent anti-convulsant activity. In 1997, retigabine was also found to induce the opening\nof voltage-gated potassium channels at resting membrane potentials, and since then, through a\nvariety of other studies, this has been established to be its main mechanism of action. \nRetigabine, acting on KCNQ2/3 potassium channels which code M-currents, is now being used for\ntreatment of epilepsy.  None of the anti-convulsants that are in clinical use today have a\ncomparable mechanism of action, i.e., through ligand activation of voltage-gated potassium\nchannels.  Several potentiation compounds are synthesized according to the scaffold of retigabine.\nHowever, considering the poor potency of retigabine and several other undesirable characteristics\nincluding its broad action on KCNQ2, 3, 4, and 5 [12], it is not clear whether these related\nstructures will fundamentally improve therapeutic efficacy.  Hence, it argues for the performance\nof a non-biased screen for new structures with potentiation activity.\nSystemic compound screens for M-current have not been reported.  Because of the rapid progress of\nmolecular cloning and functional characterization, KCNQ2 has been validated as the key molecular\ntarget of M-current.  It is therefore feasible to design non-biased high-throughput screens\nspecifically targeting to KCNQ2 channels. This justifies use of the Tl+-based fluorescence assay in\n384-well format by FDSS for the identification of modulatory compounds acting on KCNQ2 from a large\ncompound library. \nPrinciple of the assay\nThe Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [13].\nThe thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low\nbasal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels,\nextracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ2 channels,  and the KCNQ2 potassium channel,\nwhen bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence\nimaging plate reader [14, 15].The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of\nKCNQ2 is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increases.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that potentiate KCNQ2 potassium channels. This\nassay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are\ntreated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a\nthallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were\nmeasured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit.  Those CHO-K1 cells\nstably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells\nwere loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed\nby the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and\ndetected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence\nof FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was\nevaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the\ncompound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds,\nthe compound is then considered to be active as a potentiator of the KCNQ2 channel.\nProtocol for the KCNQ2 project:\n1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal\nBovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418.\n2.

Remove medium and add 25 ul/well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells. \n5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in darkness.\n6.

Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.\n12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline.\n13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110\nseconds.\n14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0.\n15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive.\ncontrols in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [16].\n16. Calculate B scores [17] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14.\n17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard\ndeviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (>=3*SD), AND the B score of\ninitial fluorescence intensity is within 3 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the\nlibrary compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as an active (Value=2) potentiator of\nthe KCNQ2 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). \n18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation\nof INT(100*LOG(B Score Potentiator Ratio), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B\nScore Potentiator Ratio), B Score Potentiator Ratio, as in the result definition.\nList of reagents\n1.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded\nbreaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer,\ngenetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible\nfor repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor\nsuppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in\nanti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is\nessential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer\ntherapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search\nfor homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step\nof HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and\nstimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions.\nOur goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as\nchemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer\ntherapies.\nDNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51\nprotein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this\nassay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides\n(47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm\nand the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1\n(BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with\nthe sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary\noligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the\nphoton emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an\nincrease in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the\nduplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA\nstrand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein\nfilament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the\nfluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this\nfluorescence.\nWe have completed the HTS on ~200000 compounds (AID 1385). Hits identified were ordered from DPI\nand their dose-response is reported here.\nMaterials\nHuman Rad 51 protein, labeled ss & ds DNA were provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence\nassay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). All buffer\nsalts were from Sigma.\nAssay\nhRad 51 protein was incubated with ss DNA to allow filament formation (37 deg C for 15 min).\nCompounds (8.5 uM final concentration) were pre-incubated with the protein for 30 min. followed by\naddition of ds DNA to initiate strand exchange.

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay\n\nThe Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase\nsignaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell\nsurface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by\nthe small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs.\nAlternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for\nhigh-throughput screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays\nconsisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of\ntarget for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The\ncompounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR\nmutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of\nthe prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other\nimportant ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1.\n\nThe HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR\nmutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled\nstreptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the\nsubstrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in\nhomogenous assay format.\nEGFR and EGFR\nmutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM\nMgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate.\nThe HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit.

The compounds selected for\ntesting in this AID met the following criteria:  1) they were active in AID 793;  2) they confirmed\nactivity in a set of experiments entitled, \"Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for\nantagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2)\" (PubChem AID 1257); and 3) they were inactive\nin a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor\nY2 (NPY-Y2): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y1 antagonism.\" (PubChem AID 1256).\nA cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were\nused to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\n\nTo measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units. Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series\nstarting at a nominal test concentration of 35 uM.\n\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).

Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.\n The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all\nwells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours.  Following incubation, the\nfirst fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the\nFLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its\nEC95 (8 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL of either test compound, High Control\n(BIIE0246, 0.28 uM final nominal concentration) or Low Control (DMSO, 0.4% final concentration) was\nadded to the appropriate wells.

The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before\nthe final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: \nRatio = (T45 / T0) \nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = (1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control)))100\nWhere: \nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and challenge\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and challenge \nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing BIIE0246 and challenge. \nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. \nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344870)\n10x ACTOne membrane potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nDulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 14190-144)\nDMEM high glucose with glutamine (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American peptide, part 60-1-11B)\nBIIE0246 (Tocris, part 1700)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\nAgents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\n(mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving\ncognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with\nthese agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients\nwith AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist,\nxanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that\nmAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from\nschizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders.\nEvidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1\nmAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have\nfailed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects\nassociated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective\ncompounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical\neffects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable\ncandidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects.\nPrevious attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other\nspecific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and\ndifficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major\nadvances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding\nsite [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be\nhighly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective\nagonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor\nrather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and\nprovide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4].\n\nThe purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic panel (M1, M2,\nM3, M4 and M5) for their ability to modulate calcium flux.\nExperimental Protocol:\nStable CHO-K1 cell lines expressing rat M1, human M2-Gqi5, human M3, rat M4-Gqi5, or human M5 were\nplated into 96-well Costar optical bottom assay plates at a concentration of 50K cells/well in 100\nmicroliters of Ham's F-12 media.   Cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C (5% CO2).  The\nfollowing day, medium was removed from cells and they were incubated in 50 microliters of Fluo-4 AM\ndiluted in assay buffer (HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) for 1 hour at\n37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 45 microliters of assay buffer.  Test compounds\nwere serially diluted in DMSO-matched assay buffer at 2X concentration and 45 microliters was\napplied to a cell-containing assay plate in an automated format using the Flexstation (Molecular\nDevices).  Calcium flux was measured over time as an increase in fluorescence (fold over basal),\nand the max minus min values for each well were copied into a custom excel template, which\nnormalized the data as a % of maximum response elicited by a high concentration of ACh control. \nThis data was then copied into Prism (version 4.0c), which fit the data to a sigmoidal\ndose-response model with variable slopes using no constraints or weighting.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Homeostasis of cellular proteins is maintained through a combination of synthesis and degradation.\nThe pathway that accounts for the majority of protein degradation is the ubiquitin-proteasomal\npathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) is highly conserved in all cells and the generation of a multi-Ub chain\ntypically targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitination is highly\nreversible and dynamic. Deubiquitination, the reverse process, is catalyzed through the action of\nenzymes referred to as isopeptidases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2]. This group of\nenzymes is collectively responsible for maintaining adequate pools of free ubiquitin and regulating\nthe ubiquitination status of cellular proteins. The class of DUBs referred to as the\nubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) family functions endoproteolytically to cleave Ub chains from a\nwide range of protein substrates. USP2a deubiquitinates fatty acid synthase (FASN) which has\nrecently been identified as an emerging oncology target [3-6]. To identify inhibitors of USP2a a\ncell-free assay was employed.\n\nThis assay takes advantage of attaching an Ub or UBL (ubiquitin-like protein) to a reporter enzyme,\nrendering the reporter catalytically inactive. The reporter enzyme chosen is phospholipase A2\n(PLA2), which has an absolute requirement for a free amino terminus. Thus, fusion of a UBL to the\nN-terminus of PLA2 inactivates PLA2.  When the UBL-PLA2 reporter enzyme is cleaved by USP2, the\nactivated reporter can subsequently act on its substrate, which is the commercially available NBD\nC6-HPC (Invitrogen).  Thus, this coupled assay gives a fluorescent read-out, which is generated\nthrough the cleavage of the PLA2 reporter enzyme. The assay, developed by Progenra, Inc. uses\nUb-PLA2 and USP2a at near equal and low (nM) amounts and has been licensed for sale by LifeSensors,\nInc. as the Ub-IsoPro1 kit.\n\nThe assay buffer, prepared fresh at the day of the assay, contains 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2mM CaCl2,\n2mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, 0.1% DMSO. 3ul of 40nM (20nM final) USP2 core, which is stored on ice, is\ndispensed into a medium-binding black solid Kalypsys 1,536 well plate using the Kalypsys dispenser.\nThe assay plate is then pinned with 23nL compound with the Kalypsys pintool in columns 5-48. The\ncontrols are pinned as follows: column 1&2 two-fold dilutions of 2M NEM in duplicate; column 3\nDMSO; column 4 2M NEM (final concentration 38.2mM). The assay plate is incubated at RT for 30min.\nSubsequently, 3uL of 40nM (20nM final) Ub-PLA2 and 40uM (20uM final) NBD C6-HPC (stored on ice and\nprotected from light) were dispensed into the plate using the Kalypsys dispenser. Plates were read\nimmediately (0 Hour) on an Envision (Perkin Elmer) plate reader using the following wavelengths Ex\n460nm /Em 535nm. Then, the assay plates were incubated for 2.5 hours and read again on the Envision\nusing the same settings\nData were normalized to the to AC100 inhibition (NEM). Concentration-response curves were fitted to\nthe normalized data and the concentration-response curves were then classified based on curve\nquality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity. The time zero reading was used to\nflag fluorescence artifacts.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene\nunder control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1\nactivation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism\nwas measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation\nof adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of\nthe CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators\nwould increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely\nproportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1\nagonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate.\n\nThe primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10\nmicromolar final concentration. \n\nThe assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in\ntriplicate. As with the primary run, SEW-2871 was used as the positive control. All data reported\nwas normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar\nSEW-2871 (i.e. 100% agonist) Vs wells that contained forskolin only (0% agonist). \nDose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal\nconcentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The\nreported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50%\nactivity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (95 micromolar) did\nnot result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually\ndepending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values\nof greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10\nmicromolar are considered active.\nIn addition to determining the Ec50 values for the #potentiator assay#, Ec50 values were also\ndetermined for the S1P1 assay in #Agonist# mode as well as counterscreened for EC50 values in the\nparental CHO Cre Bla cell line. These three assay results are submitted as individual publications.\nFor the S1P1 agonist assay execution, all parameters are identical to the #potentiator# assay\nexcept test wells only include forskolin devoid of the Ec20 concentration of SEW 2871. For the\nparental CHO Cre Bla cell counterscreen assay all parameters were again identical to the\n#potentiator assay except this cell line doesn#t express S1P1 and was tested in the presence of 4uM\nforskolin only. Ec50#s for these two assays were plotted using the same parameters as above. For\nthe agonist assay, data was normalized to the 1micromolar SEW-2871 Vs forskolin only and for the\nparental cell counterscreen, data was normalized to untreated cells Vs forskolin treated cells.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n\nFor these dose response assays, one of two cell lines was used. The S1P-1 \"potentiator\" and agonist\nassays used a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P1 receptor\n(pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct. The \"parental\" counter\nscreen dose response assay used a CHO Cre Bla cell line (Invitrogen part#K1129).\nAll cells were cultured in T-175 cm2 Corning flasks (part#431080) at 37 degrees C and 95% RH. The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco#s Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#11965-092) containing\n10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone part#SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen\npart#1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen part#11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen\npart#15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen part#25030-081), and 1x penicillin-streptomycin\n(Invitrogen part#15140-122).For the parental cell line no selection antibiotic was used but for the\nS1P1 transformed cells 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen part#10131-027) was used.\nPrior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red\nfree Dulbecco#s Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran\ntreated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM\nHEPES, and 5mM L-Glutamine. \n\nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next\nday, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and\nSEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar\n(forskolin#s EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871#s EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871\nwas also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e.\nits EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1\nmicroliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer part#K1085),\nprepared according to the manufacturer#s protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma\npart#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm\nand emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting\n#background# (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm\nfluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of\nthe positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive\ncontrol.\n" ;

The assay is based on the efficient FRET\nbetween a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC2 coactivator.\nThe fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST\nEuropium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds\nthat act as agonist ligands that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the\ndistance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As\ndesigned, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase the fluorescence at the acceptor\nemission wavelength.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium\nFluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered\nat 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.

The assay was performed in a \"duplex\"\nformat in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL)\ncell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a\nred-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells\nduring flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the\npeptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with\nhigh affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were\ndetermined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the\nduplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. \n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min.

A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably\ntransfected with the human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA)\nreporter construct was used to measure S1P2 agonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal\nactivity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. Stimulation of the S1P2 receptor by agonist\nincreases BLA gene transcription. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance\nenergy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test\ncompounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were\ntested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of\n50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media\nconsisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed\nfetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL\nGeneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay,\ncells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in assay media, which consisted of\nphenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated\nfetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X\nantibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin).\nThe assay was initiated by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well\nplate (6,000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate\nwells were then added 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 50 uM, final\nDMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1\nuL of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 370 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80%\nactivity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (100% antagonism) were added to the\nappropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The\nfluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and 2.2 uL of this mixture was then added to each well. After a further 2\nhours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and fluorescence emission\nwavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm.\nSelected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to\nnormalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels (ie,\nfluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay\ndata, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm / I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported\nEC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50%\nactivation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50\nuM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than\n50 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of\nthe compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity\nscores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\nAgents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\n(mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving\ncognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with\nthese agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients\nwith AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist,\nxanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that\nmAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from\nschizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders.\nEvidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1\nmAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have\nfailed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects\nassociated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective\ncompounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical\neffects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable\ncandidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects.\nPrevious attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other\nspecific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and\ndifficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major\nadvances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding\nsite [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be\nhighly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective\nagonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor\nrather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and\nprovide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4].\n\nThe purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M4 receptor for\ntheir ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding.\nExperimental Protocol:\nMembranes were prepared from M4-expressing CHO cells as described. Binding\nreactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 ug of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final,\nto define total binding) or 1uM atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500\nul. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in\nDMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final\nDMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at\nroom temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped\nand membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a\nBrandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4).\nFilter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter\n(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an\nacetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations\n(3 to 30uM, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after\ncounting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to\napproximately 5% or less.\nShirey JK, Xiang Z, Orton D, Brady AE, Johnson KA, Williams R, Ayala JE,Rodriguez AL, Wess J,\nWeaver D, Niswender CM, Conn PJ., \"An allosteric potentiator of M4 mAChR modulates hippocampal\nsynaptic transmission.\" Nat Chem Biol. 2008 Jan;4(1):42-50. PMID: 18059262\nData Fitting:\nData from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum\nspecific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and\nfitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no\nweighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30\nmicromolar did not fit a full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive\nstatistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and\nthe 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'\n" ;

Until\nrecently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1\nselective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which\nprohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1\nPAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all\nallosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse\nchemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS.\nCompounds were tested at 10uM (fixed) in the presence of a submaximal concentration of\nacetylcholine (ACh) (~EC20) and evaluated for their ability to elevate the response to ACh in\nrM1-expressing CHO cells.  Compounds eliciting a response greater than approximately 50% of the\nmaximum ACh response were considered 'Active.' Compounds with <50% response were considered\n'Inactive.'

To this end, we screened the MLSCN library via a cell-based assay developed by Orphagen\nPharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA).\nLigands for SF-1 may have clinical applications as modulators of adrenal steroid synthesis, and\nalso as modulators of energy metabolism and obesity through the regulation of the ventromedial\nhypothalamus (VMH).\n\nThe transcriptional cell-based assay utilizes a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast\ntranscriptional factor Gal4 with the ligand-binding domain of target receptor SF-1 (encoded by the\npFA-hSF-1 plasmid, Orphagen Pharmaceuticals) to regulate a luciferase reporter containing 5xGal4\nresponse elements at its promoter region (pG5-luc, Stratagene).

Out of 94 compounds identified during the primary\nscreen, all 94 compounds were assessed in dose response experiments in 10 point, 1:3 serial\ndilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 60 micromolar.As with the primary screen,\nthis assay is based on ability of PKA kinase to phosphorylate a Kemptide peptide sequence. PKA uses\nATP as a donor of phosphate for the \nphosphorylation of the substrate, which leads to the depletion of ATP in the reaction mix. An assay\nkit (Kinase-Glo, Promega) was used to quantify enzyme activity. Residual amounts of ATP are\nmeasured by a secondary enzymatic reaction, during which luciferase utilizes the remaining ATP to\nproduce luminescence. In this assay, the luminescent signal is directly proportional to the amount\nof ATP and inversely proportional to PKA activity. Each concentration was tested nominally in\ntriplicate.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions .\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test\ncompound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and\nAF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive\nControl Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr.\nBruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by\nHyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each\nwell. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound.\nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with\nactivating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have\nRV less than 100.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100,\nmeaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the\nsubstance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. \nAn active compound for RGS7 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 25 and the type of active\ncompound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

It\nregulates many fundamental cell functions including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation\nand protein trafficking, and plays important roles in pathological conditions such as cardiac\nhypertrophy and cancer in multiple organ systems. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects\nof PKD are not clearly understood, and the role of PKD in cancer and other diseases has not been\nfully defined. This is partly due to the lack of effective pharmacological tools that specifically\ntarget PKD in normal cellular processes and in pathological conditions. The immediate goal of this\nproposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an IMAP-based HTS fluorescent polarization (FP) assay\nand its use to identify novel PKD inhibitors. The assay we implemented is in a 384-well, small\nvolume format and has been adapted for high throughput screening.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors.\nThe present assay was developed to confirm hits from this primary screen, examining saturation\ntransfer differences in NMR spectra upon incubation of the menin protein with compound.\nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and\npeptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Buffer components for all assays\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).\nAssay Reagents:\n1. Menin protein\n2. MLL w.t. \n3. NMR buffer: 50mM phosphate, 50mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, pH = 7.5\nNMR protocol:\n1.

The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary\ngland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin\nsignaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through\nregulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis.\nSignificantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung\nfibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human\nrelaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive\nheart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic\nsclerosis.\nUpon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs.\ncAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP\nincrease is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists\nof the relaxin receptor, a THP1 cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1 activation\nwas assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit.\n\nThis is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP1\nreceptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were\nlysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell\nlysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to\na decrease in the TR-FRET signal. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (buffer\nonly) and 100% activity (29 nM porcine relaxin).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based\nhigh-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of\nprevious experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators\nor agonists of NPY-Y1\" (PubChem AID 1304), and inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2,\"\n(PubChem AID 1359) were nonselective due to agonism of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line\ntransfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism\nof the Y2 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with\nisoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity\nalso change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed,\na test compound that acts as an agonist of Y2 will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP\nlevels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well\nfluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into\neach well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added\nto the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells\ncontaining only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these\ntwo values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation\nthan the cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation\nvalue. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 9 and active compounds range\nof activity score is 9 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 3448770)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

This resulted in a concentration of 30 uM of compound\nin the assay.  For the follow up dose response assays 8 concentrations of each compound ranging\nfrom 100-1 uM were used.\nAssay Setup: 2.5 uL of M1AAP reagent mix, which included the fluorogenic peptide substrate\n(H-Leu-NHMec) in assay buffer, was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 1536-well\nplates.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS\ncan stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster\novary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected\nusing a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS).\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the NPS receptor (CHO-NPSR) was obtained\nfrom Dr. Heilig lab at NIAAA and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\n21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml\ngeneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were\nfrozen and stored at -135C. The assay was performed on a FDSS-7000 kinetic plate reader in\n1536-well format. For both agonist (1-220s) and antagonist (221-400s) phases, the maximums of\nkinetic fluorescence responses were converted separately into text files using the instrument's\nsoftware data export utility. Data for agonist response were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% activation (NPS). Data for antagonist response were normalized to the\ncontrols for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (No NPS control). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation. \nNPS 1536-well FDSS assay protocol:\n(1) Frozen CHO-NPSR cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F-12 Kaighn's\nmedia supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were\nplated at 3 ul/well (1200 cells) to black, clear-bottom, tissue-culture treated 1536-well plates,\nand then cultured at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours.\n(2) Add 3 ul of calcium dye (from High Performance PBX Calcium Assay Kit, BD Biosciences). The\ncalcium dye was prepared according to the manufactory's instruction. \n(3) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 60 to 120 min.\n(4) Load plates to FDSS-7000.

We describe a\nhigh-throughput screening (HTS) campaign that was designed to measure the metabolic activity of a\nsuspension cell line after challenge & 48 hours of incubation with test compound. For this primary\nHTS campaign the human T-cell line, Jurkat clone E6.1, was screened against the NIH set of 59,808\ndiverse compounds. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration.\nA luciferase-based cell proliferation/viability assay end point kit was used as the readout for\nthis assay. The kit measures the amount of ATP present in the microtiter plate well. If ATP is\nnot present, the catalytic conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin is not possible, and no\nluminescence results. Since metabolically active cells produce ATP, the absence of ATP correlates\nwith the presence of inviable cells.\nThis campaign was run with doxorubicin, an antibiotic used as an anti-cancer drug, as the positive\ncontrol. In this assay, doxorubicin had a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of approximately\n100 nM. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the\npresence of 4 micromolar doxorubicin (i.e. 100% inhibition). The assay was conducted in 1536-well\nformat.\nA suspension of Jurkat cells (clone E6.1; ATCC Cat# TIB-152, Invitrogen Cat# K1045) in RPMI-1640\nmedia containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, 5mM\nL Glutamine, and 1x antibiotic was prepared prior to assay. The concentration of cells in the\nsuspension was 1 million/milliliter. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension\nto each test well of a 1536 well plate. Then 20nL of test compound or control doxorubicin was\nadded. Plates were lidded and incubated at 37 deg C at 5% CO2 for 48 hrs prior to the addition of 5\nmicroliters / well of Cell-Titer Glow (Promega Corp., Madison Wisconsin). After ten minutes of\nincubation at room temperature, plates were read on the Viewlux Imaging UHTS reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron protein\nSMN. The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2\nwhich are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips\nexon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2\nprotein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1\nlocus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form,\nit is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy\nthat either increase the amount of SMN2 product made or to increase the inclusion of exon 7 has\nbeen proposed for the treatment of SMA.\nWe have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional\nSMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that\ninclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus\ngenerating functional luciferase enzyme.\n\nThis screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter and splicing based\ncassettes in tandem with the major portion of the native SMN2 cDNA, and then transfected into\nHEK293 cells.

In some patients, especially children, the toxin enters the bloodstream and causes\nhemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results in kidney, heart, and occasionally brain\ninjury. The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein\nsynthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that\nemployed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. Vero cells\nwere transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form of luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the\nproteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits protein synthesis, results in markedly\ndiminished luciferase translation. A counterscreen\nassay was used to identify nonspecific compounds that inhibit protein synthesis independent of Stx\naction. Cycloheximide (Chx) readily diffuses into cells and immediately blocks protein synthesis in\nthe absence of Stx. Stx actives that are active in the Chx assay are thus nonspecific compounds\nthat stabilize luciferase activity. \n \nSix million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2.

A cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide\ngated channel (CNGC) is used to measure Y1 antagonism by test compound. The cells are treated with\nisoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Increased CNGC activity\nincreases the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. Addition of\nagonist (NPY peptide) counteracts isoproterenol action and reduces probe fluorescence. A test\ncompound that acts as an effective Y1 antagonist will counteract NPY action, leading to increased\ncAMP levels, CNG channel opening, membrane potential, and therefore higher probe fluorescence.\n\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).

Stimulation of cells\nco-expressing ERbeta and PH-RFP with estrogen and other ERbeta agonists leads to a translocation of\nPH-RFP from a diffuse cytosolic localization to a nuclear localization.

The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds.

The rate of the\nreaction is measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm with\na PerkinElmer Envision microplate reader.  This assay was chosen rather than the HMG-CoA reductase\nreaction because the substrates, mevalonate and coenzyme A, are less expensive and more stable than\nHMG-CoA.  NADP is also more stable than NADPH, making this a more robust assay for use in a HTS\nformat.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm.\nThe purpose of this assay was to screen for compounds that would reduce the observed assay rate,\nwhich would in theory be the result of the compound inhibiting the activity of the target enzyme,\nHMGR.

        bat:hasParagraph  "In most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic\ntranscription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied\nRNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific\nregulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard\ngenetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality.  This\nscreen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins\nrequired for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First,\ninhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding\nproteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function\nacross nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent\nthat specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.\nThe two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class\ntandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the\ngermline from the soma.  MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1\ncoordinates posterior patterning and germline specification.  Both proteins can be expressed and\npurified from Escherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high\naffinity to specific RNA sequences in vitro.  Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to\neffectively monitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard\nfluorescence plate reader.\n1) Probe attributes \nSmall molecule that inhibits MEX-5 \nWorks as a transient inactivator \nKills embryos \nDoes not bind to other zinc-finger proteins \nAssay Overview:\nThe ability of purified MEX-5 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently labeled RNAs upon\nbinding is used as the basis of the assay.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous\nexperiments entitled, #Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to\nidentify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3),# (AID 1800).\nIn this assay, a DNA hairpin oligonucleotide is incubated with test compound and a fluorescent\nintercalating agent, ethidium bromide. Upon binding to the DNA molecule, the fluorescence of the\nintercalating agent increases. As designed, test compounds that bind to the DNA molecule will\ncompete with and displace the intercalating agent, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence.\nCompounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.9 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 6.5) were\ndispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO, diminazene\naceturate (80 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) were added\nto the appropriate wells.\nThe assay was started by dispensing into all wells 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented\nwith 4 micromolar ethidium bromide and 0.32 micromolar hairpin oligonucleotide. Well fluorescence\nwas read after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer).\nThe percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:\nPercent Displacement = (test_compound_ Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)/(positive_control_\nRatio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing diminazene aceturate.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Counterscreen.\nTwo values were calculated: (1) the average percent displacement of all compounds tested, and (2)\nthree times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter,\ni.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared\nactive.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % displacement values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 35 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 35 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nDNA hairpin oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc, custom synthesized)\nIntercalating agent (Ethidium Bromide) (Bio-Rad, part 161-0433)\nDiminazene Aceturate (Sigma-Aldrich, part D7770)\nMOPS (Fisher-Biotech, part BP308-100)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789173)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is\na luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from\nDiscoveRx.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nidentification of small molecule antagonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1778) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Alpha-glucosidase is responsible for hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked\nalpha-D-glucose residues with release of alpha-D-glucose. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is\nrequired for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency\nof this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe\ndisease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes\nand cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within\nlysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury. In\nturn, this leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the entire organ involved (eg, cardiomyopathy\nand muscle weakness).\nIt has reported that the improper folding and trafficking of alpha-glucosidase resulting from the\ngenetic mutations may account for a significant number of Pompe patients. N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin,\nan inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, was reported to exhibit the pharmacological chaperone activity,\nwhich significantly increases the mutant enzyme activity in cells. We optimized this\nalpha-glucosidase assay in 1536-well plate format for identifying the novel small molecule\ninhibitors with the structures other than the sugar analogs in order to develop the new\npharmacological chaperones, but are also able to detect potential activators. In conjunction with\nassays against alpha-galactosidase (AID 1467), fluorogenic false positive compounds can be\nidentified.\n\nThis is a fluorogenic enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside as the substrate\nand human alpha-glucosidase as the enzyme preparation. Upon the hydrolysis of this fluorogenic\nsubstrate, the resulting product, 1. 4-methyllumbelliferone, can be excited at 365 nm and emits at\n440 nm which can be detected by a standard fluorescence plate reader.

The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the\noriginating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily.\n\nThe present assay was undertaken to identify which of the 15 test compounds active in dose-response\nassays were FPR antagonists. The assay determines the ability of each test compound to prevent the\nrise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPR peptide agonist, fMLFF. The assay was\nperformed in low throughput mode in a flow cytometer.\n\nCalcium response experiments were done as previously described\nwith minor modifications. U937 cells expressing FPR were resuspended in warm tissue culture\nmedium (10^7 cells in 10 milliL) containing 200 nanoM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes,\nEugene, OR) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes. After\nincubation, Fluo4-loaded cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in complete HHB\nmedium (110 milliM NaCl, 30 milliM HEPES, 10 milliM KCL, 1milliM MgCl2, 10 milliM glucose, and 0.1%\n(v/v) human serum albumin, and 1.5 milliM CaCl2), allowed to equilibrate at 37 degrees C for 10\nminutes, and stored on ice.\n\nTo assess the ability of test compounds to block FPR-induced intracellular calcium responses,\nFluo4-loaded cells (1 x 10^6/milliL in 100 microL) were first incubated with or without the\ncompound for 8 minutes at 37 degrees C (final concentrations of 0 or 100 microM test compound, 1%\nv/v DMSO). Cells were next analyzed for 20 seconds in a FACScanTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)\nto establish a baseline for Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. Finally, a 100 microL volume of HHB\ncontaining 0 or 1 nanoM of fMLFF peptide was manually added and the analysis was reinitiated for an\nadditional 80 seconds. For the duration of data collection the cell suspension was maintained at 37\ndegrees C and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirbar. Fluo4 fluorescence was excited at 488\nnM and its emission intensity analyzed at 530 nm. The median Fluo4 fluorescence intensity MFI was\ndetermined at 0.6 second intervals, ~500 cells in each interval, throughout the analysis.\nThe MFI values were summed and averaged for the 20 seconds prior to stimulus addition\n(Avg_MFI_Base). The MFI values were summed over 114 measurements made during the last 70 seconds\npost-addition to determine the area under the response curve post-addition (AUC_Post). Avg_MFI_Base\nwas multiplied by 114 to obtain a baseline area under the curve estimate (AUC_Base). The response\nto stimulus was calculated as the difference: \nAUC_Response = AUC_Post - AUC_Base \nAUC_Response was calculated for 3 conditions: 1) no test compound present and fMLFF added as\nstimulus (Rmax), 2) test compound present and fMLFF added as stimulus (Rtest), and 3) test compound\npresent and HHB medium alone added as stimulus (Rmin).\nTest compound inhibition of the calcium response was calculated as:\n%Inhibition = 100 x {1 - [(Rtest - Rmin)/(Rmax - Rmin)]}\nActivity Scoring\nTest compounds resulting in greater than 90% inhibition of were considered active antagonists. The\nactivity score was calculated for active test compounds as follows:\nActivity Score = 100 x (Inhib_Test - Inhib_Min)/(Inhib_Max - Inhib_Min)\nin which Inhib_Test was inhibition mediated by the test compound, Inhib_Min was 90 (the threshold\nfor an active test compound), and Inhib_Max was the maximum inhibition observed for all test\ncompounds.\nCompounds resulting in 90% inhibition or less were assigned an activity score of 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to\nmeasure STAT3 inhibition\" (PubChem AID 862), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition\"\n(AID 1265). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were\ndeclared active in AID 862 and AID 1265; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (AID\n920); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT3\ninhibitors: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB inhibition\" (AID 1308); and 4)\nthey were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT3 inhibitors:\ncell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (AID 1317).\nIn this assay STAT3 inhibition was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably\nexpresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct.  This cell line is deficient in STAT1.  Test\ncompounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase\nreporter activity.  Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to\nactivate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring\nwell luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 inhibitor will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription,\nthus reducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to decreased well\nluminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting\nat a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM.\n\nThe inhibitor and activator dose response assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run\nsimultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and\nstreptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell\nsuspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was\nstarted by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, nifuroxazide (112 uM final\nnominal concentration, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to\nthe appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).\nNext, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final nominal EC80 concentration) was dispensed into\nall wells. The plates then were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay\nwas stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each\nwell, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on\nthe ViewLux plate reader.  \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by\nproject collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that\nare labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30\nnanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom\nexcitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a\nsingle bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0\nsupplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing.\nThe 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below)\nare centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50\nmilliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then\nresuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated\nwork station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10\nminutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10\nmilliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds\nRGS proteins with high affinity.\nThis design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is\nassociated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead\nsets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635\nnm. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7\nmight be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead\nsets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into\n384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead\ncontrol (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a\nfluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the\ntest compounds.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters\n(5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test\ncompound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is\n10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test\ncompound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are\nincubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for\neach well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of\n218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds.\nRGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of\nthe measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative\ncontrol bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that\nparticular protein is \"inconclusive\", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive\n(see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS\nProtein is \"inconclusive\", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant\namounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702\ncompounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. \nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound\n(|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or\ninhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the\ntarget RGS-Galphao interaction. \nRV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and\nRGS7, compounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8,\ncompounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library\ndependent \"edge effect\" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the\ndata set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered \"Active\". Data from compounds\nlocated in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than\n0 or greater than 135 were considered \"Active\". Active compounds include both activators - where\n%Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the\n218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as\npotential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per\nprotein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are\nRGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific.\nRGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel,\nwhich can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has\nthe lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest\nbead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead\nset, the compound is flagged as \"Potential Red Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as\npotential red fluorescent compounds.\nThe Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library,\naverage Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when\nexcluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard\ndeviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for\ntarget RGS16, due to the library dependent \"edge effect\", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68\nstandard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity\nof the protein.\nFor easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the\nsame compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an\nactivator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column\nRi_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where \"i\" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.\n" ;

Several lines of evidence indicate that\nan elevated level of galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1-p), the product of galactokinase (GALK), is a\nmajor, if not sole, pathogenic mechanism in patients with classic galactosemia. Therefore, finding\ninhibitors of GALK is a potential novel therapy for this inherent metabolic disease and is the long\nterm goal of this project.

It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is\nrequired for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency\nof this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe\ndisease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes\nand cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within\nlysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury.

The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to\nmultiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened\nagainst the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases\nincluding wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP.\nThe assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A\nset of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.\nIn the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets\nwere characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of\nfluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the\npresence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control.\nEach protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C.

Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer\nin the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery.\nMeasured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular\nequivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the\nfollowing equation;\nkMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept\nwhere MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are\nkiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5\ndifferent levels of calibration beads.\nThe resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in\nGraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation;\nkMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP)\nwhere ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP\nper bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and\nplay important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems.\nOf these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic\ntargets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of\ncholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs.\nDue to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the\nmAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been\nlargely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been\nimpossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a\nM1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and\nan antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like\nprofile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the\nantipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of\nM1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion\nthat a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide\nantipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by\nrecent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and\ndopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine\nhyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered\nhippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide\na novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1\nmay also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the\nrelative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or\nantipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly\nselective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it\nimpossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.\nThe purpose of this assay was to test the lead compounds for dose-dependency at rM4/Gqi5 using a\ncalcium uptake assay.\nAssay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye\n(2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degreesC.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate\nvolume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM\nHEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X\nstock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of\n0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to\nassay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular\nDevices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test\ncompound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were\nthen stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first\nnormalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50\nvalues for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using\nstandard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compounds that showed dose-response activity were\nassigned as 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = '100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease that involves the G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous\nsystem resulting in compulsive or abnormal behavior.  Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose\ncontribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated.\nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human delta opioid receptor\n(DOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified\nin \"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nThis image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the\narrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to\ncoated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the\nGFP-arrestins.\nAssay Materials:\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1\nreceptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics\n- 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in\nwater to 1 uM.  \n5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water\n6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO\n7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10\nmM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAssay Procedure:\n1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of\ncompounds. \n4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.

        bat:hasParagraph  " As with the primary HTS assay, the same cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the\nbeta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)\npromoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism. When the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by S1P agonist,\ntranscription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via a G-alpha-16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The\namount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. In this assay, in order to\nmeasure antagonist activity, test wells containing cells were treated with the Ec80 of the agonist\nS1P which was 800nM. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate.\nIn this experiment, 209 compounds that passed hit selection criteria, were tested for individual\nIC50 determination. Compounds that were unavailable for \"hit picking\" were not followed up on. The\ncompounds were \"hit-picked\" at a 10 millimolar concentration in DMSO and further serially diluted\nnine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations . \nEach compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. The entire campaign was run with the Ec80\nof S1P as the negative control (0% Inhibition) Vs basal cells as the positive control (100%\ninhibition). All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in\nthe presence of media only; i.e. 0% activation which should be concordant with 100% inhibition. The\nassay was conducted in 1536-well format. \n\nDose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal\nconcentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The\nreported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50%\nactivity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (49.8 micromolar)\ndid not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined\nmanually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50\nvalues of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less\nthan 10 micromolar are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n\nFor all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3\nreceptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the\nG-alpha-16 pathway coupling protein was used.\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth\nmedia consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10%\nv/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part\n1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part\n15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 2 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part\n10131-027), 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin\n(Invitrogen, part 15140-122).\nPrior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol\nred free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 0.5%\ncharcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine.\n\nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 deg C in 5% CO2. The\nnext day, 25 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of S1P [Ec80] was added\nto test wells and was also added to the appropriate negative control wells to a final concentration\nof 0.8 micromolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the\nincubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen,\nLiveBLAzer, part K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM\nprobenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates\nwere read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation\nwavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was\ncorrected by subtracting \"background\" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the\nratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent inhibition was calculated from\nthe median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the negative control signal ratio from\nthe sample well and the positive control.\n" ;

Baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation,\n470+/-20 nm, emission, 540+/-30 nm) and then 20 ul/well test compounds were added using the FDSS's\nintegrated pipettor. For concentration-response curve experiments, compounds were serially diluted\n1:3 into 10 point concentration response curves in DMSO and were transferred to daughter plates\nusing the Echo. 20 ul of test compounds (2X concentration) were applied and followed 2.5 minutes\nlater by an EC20 concentration of glutamate (10 ul of a 5x final concentration). An EC80\nconcentration of glutamate was added 2 minutes later (12 ul of a 5x final concentration). Curves\nwere fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ).\nSubsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent\nserial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and\nfit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla,\nCA). For compounds where an EC50 was determined, the 'Activity' was assigned as 'Active' and the\n'Score' was assigned as '100'. All other compounds were considered 'Inactive' and assigned a\n'Score' of '0'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Formyl peptide receptors. The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the\noriginating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily.\n\nThe present assay was undertaken to identify which of the 5 test compounds active in dose-response\nassays were FPRL1 antagonists. The assay determines the ability of each test compound to prevent\nthe rise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPRL1 peptide agonist, WKYMVm. The assay\nwas performed in low throughput mode in a plate reader.\nRBL cells expressing human FPRL1 were resuspended in warm tissue culture medium (10^7 cells in 10\nmilliL) containing 1.6 microM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and\nincubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes. After incubation,\nFluo4-loaded cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in complete HHB medium (110\nmilliM NaCl, 30 milliM HEPES, 10 milliM KCL, 1milliM MgCl2, 10 milliM glucose, and 0.1% (v/v) human\nserum albumin, and 1.5 milliM CaCl2), allowed to equilibrate at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes, and\nstored on ice.  \n100 microL of Fluo-4 labeled cell suspension plus 1 microL of test compound was added to wells of a\nNunc 96-well plate (Nunclon surface, Nuncbrand, Denmark) and allowed to warm at 37 degrees C for\n5-10 minutes. Final test compound concentration was 100 microM (1% DMSO) unless otherwise\nindicated.  Wells were then sequentially analyzed in a PerkinElmer Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter\nused in bottom counting mode with excitation at 485 nm and emission detected at 535 nm. For each\nwell there was an initial 10 s reading at 1 second intervals to establish background fluorescence\nintensity, then 100 microL of 10^-9 M WKYMVm was dispensed into the well, the plate was shaken for\n5 seconds and readings were made for an additional 30 seconds thereafter at 1 second intervals. \nThe fluorescence intensity (FI) values were summed and averaged for the 10 seconds prior to\nstimulus addition (Avg_FI_Base). The FI values were summed over the 30 measurements made during the\nlast 30 seconds post-addition to determine the area under the response curve post-addition\n(AUC_Post). Avg_FI_Base was multiplied by 30 to obtain a baseline area under the curve estimate\n(AUC_Base). The response to stimulus was calculated as the difference: \nAUC_Response = AUC_Post - AUC_Base \nAUC_Response was calculated for 2 conditions: 1) no test compound present and WKYMVm added as\nstimulus (Rmax), and 2) test compound present and WKYMVm added as stimulus (Rtest).\nTest compound inhibition of the calcium response was calculated as:\n  % Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (Rtest/Rmax)]\nActivity Scoring\nTest compounds resulting in greater than 70% inhibition were considered active antagonists. The\nactivity score was calculated for active test compounds as follows:\nActivity Score = 100 x (Inhib_Test - Inhib_Min)/(Inhib_Max - Inhib_Min)\nin which Inhib_Test was inhibition mediated by the test compound, Inhib_Min was 70 (the threshold\nfor an active test compound), and Inhib_Max was the maximum inhibition observed for all test\ncompounds.\nCompounds resulting in 70% inhibition or less were assigned an activity score of 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The pharmacological treatment of neurodegenerative disorders has been a disappointment when\ncompared to the successes obtained in stroke, other neurological diseases like seizures, and in\nmental health diseases. It has to be said that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and\ntheir early diagnosis represent a definite obstacle to effective intervention. \nNuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a key cellular signaling factor in the central nervous system.\nAlthough NF-kB signaling pathways have been extensively investigated in cancer and in immunological\ndiseases, NF-kB role in the central nervous system physiology and pathology in non inflammatory\ndisorders of the brain is still unclear. NF-kB has an important role as an inhibitor of neuronal\napoptosis and at least in this capacity it represents an interesting target to pursue. Recent\nevidence has also pointed out that this signaling system is involved in the resilience of neurons\nand in their ability to survive disparate insults. Functional knock out models of NF-kB, achieved\nvia over-expression of its natural repressor I-kB, have shown that neurons from these animals are\nmore sensitive to insults including trauma, Beta-amyloid toxicity and excitotoxicity. Also a direct\nneuroprotective effect from both non apoptotic and apoptotic models of neurodegeneration has been\nattributed to direct or indirect activation of NF-kB signaling. In addition, to the direct\nneuroprotective effect NF-kB up-regulation could also be of value in improving learning and memory.\nIn fact, NF-kB signaling has been shown to improve long term potentiation and long term depression,\ntwo models of learning at cellular level. This background is of great appeal because up regulation\nof NF-kB in neurons could be useful in attacking, at the same time, neuronal degeneration and\ndeterioration of neuronal functions associated with loss of learning and memory as seen in\nAlzheimer#s disease. To pursue this scope, we have set up a novel human cell-based assay to\nidentify small molecules able to up-regulate NF-kB expression for high throughput screening.\nThe cell line developed for this assay, which is used to identify pharmacological probes for the\nactivation of NF-kB, was prepared as follows. The SH-5YSY human neuroblastoma cell line was doubly\nstably transfected with a reporter construct coding the human NF-kB promoter driving the expression\nof the firefly luciferase and a reporter coding the resistance to the antibiotic blasticidin. \nTNF-alpha was used as a positive control as it a potent enhancer of NF-kB expression.  Negative\ncontrol wells were treated with vehicle only.  \nCell Culture:  SH-5YSY (ATCC) cells stably transfected with a reporter construct containing the\nhuman NF-kB promoter fused upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter and blasticidin resistance\n(clone C1) were subcultured every 3-4 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) high glucose\n(1X) with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate + 10% FBS + 3 ug/mL of blasticidin, and incubated at 37C\nin 5% CO2, and maintained at a subconfluent density of no more than 240,000 cells/cm2 for less than\n30 passages.\nCell Culture Reagents used:\n1. D-MEM high glucose (1X), liquid, with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate   Invitrogen: 11995-065\n2. Blasticidin S HCl Invitrogen:  R210-01\nAssay Conditions: \n1. Dispense 5 nL of compounds with Echo 550 (10mM Stocks) to plates and seal plates over-night.  \n2. Add (+) Control (5ng/mL TNF-alpha final at 4X concentration) in 1uL, carrier control (0.1% DMSO\nfinal at 4X concentration) in 1uL with the Biomek FX and 1uL media to the compound wells of each\nplate with the Multi-Drop Combi.\n3.

The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner.

Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\n\nBasic protocol:\n1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media\n(DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate).\n2. The following day, media is removed from the cells.\n3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added.\n4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT.\n5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual\nvolume.\n6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT.\n7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS.\n8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20\nul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well,\n50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or\nDMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142\nseconds. The read continues for 300 seconds.\nData analysis:\nData were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a\ngiven trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in\nwhich antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the\nfluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in\nthe baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase\nbeginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after\nthallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation\nusing Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ).\nThis compound was a potent positive allosteric modulator of rat mGluR4 and was assigned an\n'Outcome' of 'Active' and a 'Score' of '100'.\n" ;

In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a\ncyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or\ndirect agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to\nactivate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)\nconcentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell\nmembrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that\nacts as an Y1 potentiator or agonist will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels,\nreduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence.\nCompounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2\nHEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed\ninto each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in\n0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was\nadded to the appropriate wells.

The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol.\nAny compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the\nPrimary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100%\nof the highest observed activation value.

        bat:hasParagraph  "A cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP\nResponse Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to measure S1P2 agonism. Under\nnormal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels.\nWhen the S1P2 receptor is stimulated by an agonist, transcription of the BLA gene occurs\nproportionally to agonist concentration, and BLA activity in the sample is increased. This increase\nis monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic\ncell permeable BLA substrate.\n\nFor this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with  human S1P2\nreceptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used.\nCells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of\npenicillin, streptomycin and neomycin).\n\nPrior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in assay media,\nwhich consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2%\ncharcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM\nL-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). \nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate (5000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate\nwells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 4.5\nmicromolar, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) followed\ndirectly afterwards by 1 microliter of 2% BSA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions.\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test\ncompound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and\nAF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive\nControl Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr.\nBruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by\nHyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each\nwell. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound.\nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with\nactivating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have\nRV less than 100.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100,\nmeaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the\nsubstance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. \nAn active compound for RGS4 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 26 and the type of active\ncompound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

The\ncompounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the following criteria: 1) they were\ndeclared active in AID 932; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments\nentitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation\" (PubChem\nAID 871).\nIn this assay activation of NF-kB transcription was measured using a human HEK 293T cell line that\nstably expresses a human NF-kB::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their\nability to increase TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to\ntest compounds, followed by treatment with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kB transcription. Changes in\nNF-kB::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An activator will increase\nTNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB transcription, thus activating the luciferase reporter gene, and\nincreasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that increase NF-kB activity are\nconsidered non-selective activators.\n\nThe activator and inhibitor counterscreen assays using NF-kB::luciferase cells were run\nsimultaneously. HEK 293T cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media\n(DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin\nand streptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin, and 1 ug/mL puromycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5%\nCO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 0.94 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell\nsuspension (3,760 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. Cells were\nallowed to adhere to plates by incubation at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 18 hours. The\nassay was started by dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO\nto sample wells, while High Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 100%\nactivation). A subset of wells received MG-132 (100 uM final nominal concentration in DMSO) to\nmonitor that the assay was functioning properly. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37\ndegrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant TNF-alpha (5.6 ng/ml final\nconcentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This TNF-alpha concentration\nresulted in approximately 80% NF-kappaB::luciferase reporter activity. Next, plates were incubated\nfor 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of\nSteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at\nroom temperature for 15 minutes.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The E3 ligases are involved in regulating other proteins by covalent ligation to the 76 amino acid\nprotein ubiquitin. This post-translational modification can result in altered conformation, altered\nactivity, or degradation of the substrate protein. Thus, E3 ligases are effectors of a major means\nof post-translational modification of proteins in many species, including mammals. The dipeptide\nboronic acid bortezomib is a potent proteasome inhibitor, has selective anticancer activity in\ntumor cells and in mice and was recently approved for clinical use in multiple myeloma. MDM2 E3\nligase is involved in numerous types of human cancer. Selective E3 ligase inhibitors would be\npreferable as they would be more selective and less toxic.\nInhibitors of the MDM2-UBCH5 interaction should disrupt the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 and\ntherefore its oncogenic activity. Such inhibitors could be developed into novel therapeutic agents\nfor sarcomas involving MDM2 overexpression or amplification, irrespective of their p53 status.\nPatients with sarcomas are likely to\nbenefit from this approach because of their high frequency of MDM2 protein overexpression and MDM2\ngene amplification.\n\nCellular autoubiquitination assay: an MDM2-GFP fusion protein\nautoubiquitinates and autodegrades in vivo. This approach was adapted to luciferase, because\nluciferase is easier to detect in high-throughput assays. A cellular assay for autoubiquitination\nin 384-well format was designed. An MDM2 E3-luciferase fusion protein was stably transfected into\nmammalian cells. The fusion protein autoubiquitinates, targeting itself for degradation.\nLuminescence is used to monitor protein abundance. A negative control of inactive RING domains\nfused to\nluciferase, known to have no ubiquitination activity, has been developed as a counterscreen. \nWe have used a cell-based MDM2 autoubiquitination screen to identify small molecules that inhibit\nMDM2 E3 ligase activity. The cell based assay uses full-length MDM2 fused to luciferase. This\nconstruct autoubiquitinates itself and autodegrades. The screen will identify compounds that\nprevent this autodegradation and stabilize the MDM2-luciferase construct by blocking MDM2 E3 ligase\nactivity. Thus inhibitors will show an enhanced luminescence signal. \nWe have earlier screened 218,724 compounds of the MLSCN library (AID 1230) and identified 220\nactives. Of these, only 200 compounds were available from DPI for retesting. We report here the\ndose-response testing on these 200 compounds. \n\n\nCells were plated and allowed to settle at 37C overnight.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel\ntherapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the\nintersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby\noffering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest,\nsince they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly\nactivate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nThe NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific\nmotifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce\nactivation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a\ngeneral bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria\n(S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M.\ntuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).\n Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in\ncells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing\nconvenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells.\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved\nin inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human\nbreast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of\ncycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release.\n\nGamma-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if\nthe primary and confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD1-mediated NF-kB pathway. NOD1\nspecifically detects Gamma-Tri-DAP, a tripeptide motif found in Gram-negative bacterial\npeptidoglycan, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kB pathway. Here we used\nGM-Tri-DAP to induce IL-8 secretion in MCF-7 cells.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nluminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" (AID 1578) and followed\nup in \"SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" )AID 2072) to study the structure-activity\nrelationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial\nsources or synthesized internally.\n\n1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1\n2. GM-Tri-DAP (Sigma)\n3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)\n4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices)\nProtocol:\n1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added\ninto respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations.\n2. GM-Tri-DAP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of\nMCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter).\n3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC\n(5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours.\n4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit\nfrom BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences)\nwere coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium\ncarbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer\n(PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room\ntemperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of\nstandards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes,\n100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then\nsealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the\nplate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and\nabsorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular\nDevices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed.\n5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve\nanalysis.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Selective M1 activation is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive\nimpairment, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and a number of other CNS disorders.  Until\nrecently, no highly selective M1 activators existed, and those that claimed to be highly M1\nselective were either not centrally penetrant or possessed significant ancillary pharmacology which\nprohibited their use as probes to study M1 receptor function. We have identified that different M1\nPAM chemotypes display different modes of activity on downstream receptor signaling.  Thus, all\nallosteric M1 activation is not equivalent, and additional tool compounds representing diverse\nchemotypes are required to truly dissect and study M1 function in the CNS.\nAssay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human M3 were loaded with calcium indicator dye\n(2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37C.  Dye was removed and replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X\nHBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All\ncompounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X stock in 0.6 percent DMSO. This\nstock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3 percent. \nAcetylcholine (ACh) submax concentration (ca. EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay\nbuffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a\nFLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were\npreincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist,\nacetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca.\nEC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the\nmaximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad\nPrism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). Compound\ndose-response curves with R2 > 0.5 were assigned as 'Active.' The 'Score' was assigned as '100' for\ncompounds with EC50<1uM and as '50' for compounds with EC50>1uM.

Additionally, compounds\nselected for testing in this AID were not active or exhibited at least a 3-fold lower % Activation\nvalue (compared to AID 631) in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary biochemical high throughput\nscreening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by\nPPARgamma\" (PubChem AID 1032) and \"Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify\nagonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by PPARgamma\" (PubChem AID 731).\nThis assay tests the ability of compounds to increase interactions between PPARg and its\ncoactivator SRC-1, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) between a\nGST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-1 coactivator.  The\nfusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST\nEuropium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. \nCompounds that promote the association of SRC-1 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the\ntwo entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies.  As designed, a compound\nthat acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM\nSodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46\ncolumns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3\nmicrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC-1\nprotein [aa 601-762].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (10 micromolar final nominal concentration), test compounds,\nor DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells.  The plates were then\nincubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured.  After excitation at 340\nnm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate\nreader (Perkin Elmer). \nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical\nexpression:\nRatio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl)) \nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds\nwith an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of Reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part 71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC-1 protein [aa 601-762] (produced by Dr. Scott Busby, Scripps Florida).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is\na luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from\nDiscoveRx.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nidentification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits.

The fusion protein and\ncoactivator are recognized by the fluorophore-labeled antibodies, anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK)\ndonor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. \nAgonist ligands that promote the association of the SRC-1 coactivator with the fusion protein will\nshorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated\nantibodies in the complex. Therefore, agonist activity is detected as an increase in fluorescence\nat the acceptor emission wavelength.\n\nThe assay was run in black solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates.\nFive microliters of HTRF assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride (Sigma, part#449148-25G), 0.5%\n(w/v) CHAPS (Sigma, part# C5070-5G), 100mM Sodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part# 71505), 0.1%\nBovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma, part# A3294-10G), pH7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were\ndispensed column 1-2 of the plate. \nThe remaining 46 columns were filled with five microliters of HTRF assay buffer supplemented with\n106 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK (CisBio, part#61GSTKLB), 2 ug/mL of anti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC,\nPerkinElmer, part# AD0059F), 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part# P4036)\nand 40 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-1 protein [aa 627-786] (produced by Dr. Swati Prasad, The Scripps\nResearch Institute, FL).\n\nMicroplates were then centrifuged for 30s at 300g to allow buffer to sit uniformly at the bottom of\neach well. Forty nanoliters of controls or test compounds (8 micromolar final nominal\nconcentration, 0.8% final DMSO concentration) were then distributed to each well. \nPlates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius.\nAfter this incubation time, microplates were allowed to equilibrate 30 minutes at room temperature\nbefore being centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.\nAfter excitation at 340 nm, wells fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with\nthe ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\n" ;

Cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by\nmeasurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium\nindicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium\nmobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased\nwell fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors. Compounds are tested\nin triplicate at a nominal concentration of 5.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity\n(RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v\nheat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin,\nstreptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay, 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536\nwell microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2\nuL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus\n(prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1\nhour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to\nthe appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room\ntemperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm\nemission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO (EC84\naverage response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time\nfluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO alone (no ATP).\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two\nvalues were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound\nwells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a\ncutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that\nparticular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative %\ninhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-25, and for inactive compounds 24-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO cells (ATCC, part CCL-61)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (ABD Bioquest, part 2456)\nHam's F-12 media (Invitrogen, part 11765-054)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, part 159910)\nAgonist: ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, part A6559)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues. Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders.\nTo identify NPSR antagonists, we developed a cell-based assay with transfected NPS receptor. NPS\ncan stimulate the production of cAMP as well as release intracellular calcium in Chinese hamster\novary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in intracellular calcium can be detected\nusing a calcium indicator dye on a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS). To validate the\nspecific action of compounds on the NPS receptor, a counterscreen was developed that tests\ncompounds' antagonism of AVPR1B vasopressin receptor stimulation by vasopressin. Vasopressin shares\n27% identity with the NPS receptor.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human vasopressin receptor (AVPR1B) was\nmaintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 21127) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100\nunits/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a humidified\natmosphere.

NPS can stimulate the\nproduction of cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing NPS receptor. This change in\nintracellular cAMP level can be detected by a homogeneous LANCE cAMP assay based on the TR-FRET\n(time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex and a cAMP-specific antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. The europium-labeled cAMP tracer\ncomplex is formed by the tight interaction between Biotin-cAMP (b-cAMP) and streptavidin labeled\nwith Europium-W8044 chelate (Eu-SA). Light pulse at 320 nm excites the europium of the cAMP tracer\nand the energy emitted is transferred to the Alexa molecule bound to the cAMP antibody, generating\na TR-FRET signal at 665 nm. Residual energy from the europium will produce a light at 620 nm. The\nnative unlabeled cAMP from cell lysates competes with the europium-cAMP tracer for antibody binding\nand reversely reduces the emission signal of Alexa by interrupting FRET between the two labeled\nmolecules. Both emission signals from the FRET donor (620 nm) and the acceptor (665 nm) can be\ndetected by a plate reader in the TRF mode. Expression of result in fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620\nnm) helps to normalize differences due to cell density and reagent dispensing.

        bat:hasParagraph  "To characterize binding of small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERbeta, a\nseries of dose-response curves were completed for compounds with suggested ERbeta binding ability\nin primary screening using a competitive binding approach using whole cells. This assay assesses\nthe affinity of small molecules with unknown ERbeta binding affinity to compete with an\nAlexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERbeta in permeabilized whole cells\nexpressing ERbeta-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist\ncharacteristics of molecules that bind ERbeta will be assessed using various secondary assays.\nThe assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6\nCos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with\nERbeta-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructrions). Twenty-four\nhours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2\nmilliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM\nL-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping\nand resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. \nThe assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains\npositive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells.\nDose-response curves are arrayed across the plate in duplicate with low concentrations in columns 3\nand 14 and increasing concentrations of compounds (in 1/2-log increments) in columns 4-11 and\n15-22, respectively. Columns 12 and 13 contain untransfected cells. Sixteen unknown compounds per\nplate were assayed in dose-responses in this manner. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO\nare diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells\ncontaining 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10\nminutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA,\n100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in\ndH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and\nthe plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100\nmicroL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells\nare sampled using the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer\n(Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM\nlaser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). \n\nAcquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery\nidentifies 384- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population\nis identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for\nanalysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the\nbasis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and\ndefined as having 100% binding E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on\ntheir E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells using:\n%Binding = 100 * Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF\nwhere Sample MCF is the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from sample well and Negative Control MCF\nis the mean channel fluorescence in FL-8 from wells with vehicle (DMSO) control. These %Binding\ndata were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear\nleast-squares regression on a sigmoidal dose response model. Some dose response data converged with\nvariable slopes (four parameter logistics equation) and some dose response data converged with Hill\nSlope set to 1 (three parameter logistics equation), see column entitled HILLSLOPE. Curve fit\nstatistics reported concentration of compound at 50% effect (EC50, nanoM), low and high boundaries\nof the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, the Hill Slope, and the correlation\ncoefficient (RSQR) indicative of goodness-of-fit.\nReporting of EC50 estimates were made only for compound data that converged in Prism with a 95%\nconfidence interval. Maximum EC50 reported was set at 10 microM or 10,000 nanoM. Any compound with\nestimate EC50 greater than this cutoff was noted with > in the ACTIVITY_QUALIFIER column.\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was computed based on three parameters of the dose-response curves.\nA score of 0-30 was assigned to each compound based on %Binding of fluorescent ligand at the 10uM\npoint of the dose-response curve, where:\n0 = 70% < %Binding\n10 = 50 < %Binding < 70%\n20 = 30 < %Binding < 50%\n30 = %Binding < 30%\nA score of 0-50 was assigned to each curve based on the estimated EC50 value (in M), where:\n0 = 10^-5 < EC50\n10 = 10^-6 < EC50 < 10^-5\n20 = 10^-7 < EC50 < 10^-6\n30 = 10^-8 < EC50 < 10^-7\n40 = 10^-9 < IC50 < 10^-8\n50 = EC50 < 10^-9\nA score of 0-20 was assigned to each curve based on the magnitude of the dose-response curve of\nE2-Alexa633 binding using: MAGNITUDE = TOP - BOTTOM values from the Prism curve-fit, where:\n0 = MAGNITUDE < 30 or MAGNITUDE > 100\n10 = 30 < MAGNITUDE < 45\n20 = 45 < MAGNITUDE < 100\nThese three scoring parameters were summed to give the possible maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100.\nCompounds were considered \"Active\" if the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was 50 or greater and given\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. \"Non-Active\" compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE less than 50\ngiven PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Shiga toxin (Stx) is released by certain strains of E. coli and is associated with food-borne\ngastroenteritis. In some patients, especially children, the toxin enters the bloodstream and causes\nhemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results in kidney, heart, and occasionally brain\ninjury. The pathogenic effects of Stx arise by the toxin entering cells and inhibiting protein\nsynthesis. To identify inhibitors of Stx activity and transport, a cell-based assay was used that\nemployed luciferase activity as a measure of protein synthesis in Stx-treated cells. Vero cells\nwere transduced with an adenovirus expressing a form of luciferase that is degraded rapidly by the\nproteasome (pAd-luc). Exposure to Stx, which inhibits protein synthesis, results in markedly\ndiminished luciferase translation. A counterscreen\nassay was used to identify nonspecific compounds that inhibit protein synthesis independent of Stx\naction. Cycloheximide (Chx) readily diffuses into cells and immediately blocks protein synthesis in\nthe absence of Stx. Stx actives that are active in the Chx assay are thus nonspecific compounds\nthat stabilize luciferase activity. \n \nSix million Vero cells were seeded in a T225 flask and grown 24 hrs at 37 C and 5% CO2. The medium\nwas replaced and the cells infected with 3 x109  plaque forming units of pAd-luc for 24 hrs at 37 C\nand 5% CO2. Cells were then suspended and dispensed at 750 cells/5 uL/well into white solid\n1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following a 24 hr incubation at 37 C\nand 5% CO2, 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle was added to each well by a pin tool, the plates were\nincubated 30 min at 37 C and 5% CO2, and 1 uL/well cyclohemixide (1 ug/mL final concentration) was\nadded. The plates were centrifuged 30 s at 1000 RPM and incubated 6 hr at 37 C and 5% CO2. After\naddition of 3 uL Photinus luciferase detection reagent, the plates were incubated 10 min at ambient\ntemperature and then read by an ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) to detect luminescence.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small (~20-25 nucleotides), nonprotein-coding RNAs that\nare involved in post-transcriptional repression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). \nEstimated to be involved in the regulation of 30% of all protein-coding mRNAs, \nmiRNAs play a significant role in many biological processes including cellular\ndifferentiation and tissue development. Not surprisingly, miRNAs have\nbeen found to be oncogenic or tumor suppressive, with altered miRNA expression levels associated\nwith human cancers. The miRNA miR-21 has been found to be\nexpressed in most human tissues, and its overexpression has been associated\nwith a variety of human tumors. miR-21 has been shown to be\nanti-apoptotic: knock-down of miR-21 in a glioblastoma cell line was found to activate caspases and\nlead to apoptosis. Identification of small molecules that modulate miR-21\nspecifically, or miRNAs generally, would prove useful as tools to better understand miRNA\nbiogenesis and mRNA regulation by miRNAs. Of special interest are compounds that specifically\ninhibit miR-21, and a cell-based firefly luciferase reporter gene assay optimized for 1536-well\nformat quantitative HTS (qHTS) has been developed in an effort to identify such compounds.\n\nHeLa cells stably expressing firefly luciferase (FLuc) under the control of a CMV\npromoter (upstream) and a miR-21 binding sequence directly downstream of the gene. These cells\nendogenously express miR-21. \nControl compounds used were compound C3 (provided by collaborator), N6-phenyladenosine (MP\nBiomedicals, 0215379625), and DMSO.\n\n 6uL of HeLa miR-21-FLuc cells in assay buffer (DMEM, Invitrogen #21063-029; 10% FBS,\nHyClone #SH30071.03) were dispensed at 2000cells/well (3.3 x 105 cells/mL) into Greiner solid-white\nTC-treated 1536-well plates using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were\nincubated for one hour at 37 degree Celsius, 95% humidity, 5% CO2. These assay plates were then\ntreated with 23nL of compound or DMSO using a Kalypsys pin tool, which allows for delivery of a\n24-point titration of each compound to the assay plate, with a final compound concentration ranging\nfrom approximately 40uM to 5pM. Assay plates were then incubated for 48 hours. After incubation,\nplates were allowed to come to RT for one hour prior to delivery of 3uL of 3X luciferase detection\nreagent. After a 15 minute incubation to allow for cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured\nusing a ViewLux CCD imager (PerkinElmer), with an average exposure time of 2-12 seconds. \n" ;

In this assay, a fluorescent compound, HiLyte fluor TM 488, is attached at the\nN-terminus of a 3CLpro peptide substrate and is FRET quenched by a QXLTM520 moiety attached at the\nC-terminus. When the peptide is cleaved by SARS-3CLpro the fluorescent compound and quencher\nseparate, leading to an increase in well fluorescence when measured at an excitation wavelength of\n485nm and an emission wavelength of 535nm. As designed, compounds that inhibit 3CLpro activity will\nprevent cleavage of the labeled peptide substrate, thus leaving the fluorescent tag unquenched on\nthe peptide, resulting in no increase in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at\na final nominal concentration of 6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 4 ul of 3CLpro enzyme (150 nM final concentration) in assay buffer\n(50mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton-X 100, 2 mM DTT) at pH 7.5 was dispensed into each well of\na 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, 3CLpro inhibitor (300 uM final\nconcentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) was added to the appropriate\nwells. The plates were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The assay was started by\ndispensing 1 ul of 3Clpro peptide substrate (2 uM final concentration) in 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 to\neach well.

Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose\ncontribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated.\nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human delta opioid receptor\n(DOR).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19.\nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS16 that value had been determined to be 30 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a\nloss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in\nmodulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\n\nBasic protocol:\n1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media\n(DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate).\n2. The following day, media is removed from the cells.\n3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added.\n4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT.\n5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual\nvolume.\n6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT.\n7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS.\n8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20\nul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well,\n50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or\nDMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142\nseconds. The read continues for 300 seconds.\nData analysis:\nData were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a\ngiven trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in\nwhich antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the\nfluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in\nthe baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase\nbeginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after\nthallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation\nusing Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ).\nThis compound was a weak positive allosteric modulator of human mGluR6 and was assigned an\n'Outcome' of 'Active' and a 'Score' of '50'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "   To identify novel compounds that can act as estrogenic activators, a time-resolved fluorescence\nresonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) has been developed in a 384-well format.  \nThis assay monitors the potentiation of the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand\nbinding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a\nlong-lifetime europium. The interaction of ER-alpha with SRC1 under a low estradiol concentration\nbrings europium and Cy5 into proximity, generating basal level of FRET. Compounds that can further\nenhance the interaction with increased FRET signal are identified as positives for further\nanalysis. These compounds could either be conventional \nligand agonists or potentiators of coactivator-ER-alpha binding that operate by a mechanism\ndistinct from binding as agonists in the ligand binding pocket. Distinction between these two\nmechanisms requires various counter-screening assays.\nCompounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 639 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha\nCoactivator Binding Potentiators, were selected for testing in this assay.  Each compound was\ntested in 6 concentration, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 50\nmicromolar.  Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  \n\n1.

Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate.\n3. Add library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2\nhr. \n4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330\nnm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm.\n\n1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios:\nFRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000\n2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of control is\ncalculated with the following equation based on data from each plate.\n% of Control = ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100\nWhere FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an\naverage FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET\nratio from wells containing Eu-ER-alpha protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. \nFor each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using BioAssay software\nfrom CambridgeSoft, using this equation:\nY = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(X/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom\nThe fitted value of X50 is reported as the EC50.  In some cases, no curve could be fit to the data:\nWhen no EC50 could be determined, a value of 9999 was substituted for the EC50.\nWhen no EC50 could be determined, a value of 10000 was substituted for the EC50 Standard Error.\nWhen no EC50 could be determined, a value of -1 was substituted for the Pct Control at EC50.\nWhen no EC50 could be determined, a value of 0 was substituted for the R2 value.\nThe Pct of Control at the EC50 was then determined, representing the level of potentiation that\nthis compound provided at the EC50 mark.  \nHowever, in some cases the standard error of the EC50 value was judged to be too high to be a\nreliable result.  \nWhen an acceptable EC50 was determined by curve fitting, the Percent of Control at the Ec50 is\nreported as the \"Reported Pct Control\".  When no EC50 could be determined, or when the EC50\nstandard error was judged to be too high, the percentage of control at 12.5 uM concentration is\nreported as the \"Reported Pct Control\".  \nThe outcome was determined as follows:\nWhen an acceptable EC50 was determined by curve fitting, compounds with EC50 < 30 uM were reported\nas Active.\nwhen no acceptable EC50 was determined, compounds with Reported Pct Control >300% were reported as\nActive.\nThe activity score was calculated based on the observed range of the Reported Pct Control values\nobtained, according to the following formula:\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - ((IC50 - HighestPctControl) / (HighestPctControl -\nLowestPctControl)))\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Confirmation biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor\ncoactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\n(PPARgamma).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm PPARgamma/SRC3 activity of compounds identified as active\nin at least two of the following experiments: \"Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay\nfor agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome\nproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)\" (PubChem AID 731), \"Primary biochemical High\nThroughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment\nby the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)\" (PubChem AID 631), and\n\"Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor\ncoactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\n(PPARgamma)\" (PubChem AID 1032).\nThis assay tests the ability of compounds to modulate the interactions between PPARg and its\ncoactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a\nGST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC3 coactivator. The fusion\nprotein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands\nthat promote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two\nentities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that\nacts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride,\n100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns\nwere filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3\nmicrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged\nSRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM\nfinal nominal concentration) or DMSO (0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells.\nImmediately after addition of test compounds fluorescence (t0) was measured by exciting at 340 nm,\nand reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate\nreader (Perkin Elmer). The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and\nfluorescence was measured again (t15). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored\nat 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated for each timepoint, according to the following\nmathematical expressions:\nt15_Ratio = t15_I671nm / t15_I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl))\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nData were evaluated using % Activation.

Compounds tested in this assay were inactive in a\nset of experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R;\nHCRTR1): Homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based assay to identify\nantagonists of the parental CHO-K1 cell line\" (AID 493232), are nonselective due to inhibition of\nGq activity. This assay will determine dose response curves.\nThis assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and parental\nCHO-K1 cells. In this assay, CHO-K1 cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody,\nand D2-IP1. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based\ndetection of Gq activity. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from\nthe antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Endogenous cellular IP1 production by\nthe CHO-K1 cells will compete with labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby\nreducing FRET. As designed, compounds that reduce Gq activity will reduce cellular IP1 production\nand also reduce the levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased\ninteractions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET.\nCompounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 66.2 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe parental CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media\nconsisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified\nfetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well\nmicrotiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate\nwells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of ATP agonist in\nDMSO (\"EC Challenge\"), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for\n1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of\nCryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room\ntemperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm\nbandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm\n(with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the Envision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I671nm / I618nm\nWhere:\nI671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm.\nI618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1- ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing Assay buffer and DMSO.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 66.2 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 66.2 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 100-0.

The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary\ngland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin\nsignaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through\nregulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis.\nSignificantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung\nfibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human\nrelaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive\nheart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic\nsclerosis.\nUpon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs.\ncAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP\nincrease is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation.  To screen for agonists\nof the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists\nof the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit GPR7 activity. Although GPR7 is\nnaturally coupled to G&#945;i, which decreases cAMP levels upon activation, this assay employs a\nchimeric cell line that forces the receptor to use Gqi3, and therefore the assay readout is calcium\nrelease. In this assay HEK cells stably co-transfected with the human GPR7 receptor and G&#945;qi3\n(hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of\nintracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye.\nAs designed, compounds that act as GPR7 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting\nin decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test\ncompounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200\nmicrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 0.625 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of\n1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23\nhours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1\nmM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well.\nAfter incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO,\nor DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30\nminute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm\nexcitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15\nnL of GPR7 agonist (2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the\nappropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the\nremaining 180 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = [ 1 - ((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control\n- Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPW.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary\nScreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test\ncompound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used\nas a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than\nthat particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. \nThe PubChem Activity Score has been set to 100 for active compounds and 0 for inactive compounds.\nList of Reagents:\nhGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line (provided by Assay Provider)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (ABD Bioquest, part 2456)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nHygromycin-B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Omega scientific, part FB-02)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n1536-well plates (Aurora, part 19326)\nhNPW-23 (Aanaspec, part 61653)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito borne infectious agent that causes febrile illness and\noccasionally encephalitis.  Outbreaks had been reported in Africa, Asia, and Europe since 1937.  In\n1999, the first case of WNV was detected in New York City from which time the virus spread rapidly\nwest resulting in the largest epidemics of neuroinvasive WNV disease ever reported in the US. \nCurrently, there is no vaccine for human use or antivirals that are available to treat WNV\ninfections, leading to patient care which is mainly supportive. Hence this program will provide\nchemical probes from which to optimize leads for treatment of this emerging disease.\n \nTo screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format. The assay\nmeasures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in Vero E6 cells by WNV infection using cell viability as\nthe end point. The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by WNV infection involves challenging 3,000\ncells with WNV virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in the presence of the compounds\nto be screened. The WNV virus strain NY-99 stock was prepared from Vero E6 cells at the SRI BSL-3\nfacility. The assay includes both cell and virus controls and cell survival was measured 96 h post\nvirus addition using CellTiterGlo viability reagent (Promega). Percent cell viability was\ncalculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of\ncompound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. The percent cell viability was taken as an\nassessment of antiviral activity. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. \nCell Culture: Vero E6 cells were cultured in Eagles modified MEM (E-MEM) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10%\nFBS and 100 U of penicillin, 100 ug of streptomycin per mL (culture media). The cells are\nmaintained at 37C, 5.0% CO2 to 100% confluence being passaged every seven days. For cell plating,\ncells were detached from flask bottom by using Trypsin-EDTA solution and then re-suspended in a\ngrowth media\nWNV culture: WNV strain NY-99 was used for screening. The WNV stock was prepared in Vero E6 cells\nusing an initial stock obtained from Dr. Heil. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were grown in two T-150\nplates to 90% confluence. After the supernatant was removed from the culture, 2ml of WNV at 10E7\npfu/ml was then added to the culture media. Virus was adsorbed to cells for 2 hours at 37C and then\nthe fresh culture media was replaced. After four days incubation, the supernatant was harvested and\nthe cell debris pelleted by low speed centrifugation. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000\nrpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80C. These\nvirus stocks were titrated in Vero E6 cells using agarose overlay plaque method and the titer was\n8.3E7 pfu/ml. \nControl and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and\n5 uL was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue\nculture treated plates. Test compounds were diluted in media to 60 uM with a DMSO concentration of\n0.6%. 5 uL was also dispensed to the assay plate. The final DMSO concentration in the assay was\n0.1% for the single dose screen and 0.5% for the dose response screen.\nCell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 3,000 cells/well\nwere plated in 15 uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37C, 5.0% CO2 and\nhigh humidity. Then the plates were transferred to a BSL-3 containment laboratory. \nVirus Addition: WNV stock was diluted in the culture media to 60,000 pfu/ml and 10 uL was added to\nthe compound wells and the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.1 ~ 0.2). Media only (mock virus)\nwas added to the cell control wells. All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a\nclass II Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-3 laboratory. The plates were incubated in an actively\nhumidified incubator with 5.0% CO2 at 37C for 96 h. \nEndpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an\nequal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well. Plates were incubated\nfor 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision\nmulti-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-3\nfacility. \nCompounds Screened: A single dose screen of the current full set of compounds from the MLSMR was\nperformed at a concentration of 10 uM.  Compounds in the single dose assay were evaluated on the\nbasis of % inhibition of the virus compared to cell only control.  The 601 most potent compounds\nwere resupplied for a dose-response confirmatory assay.  These compounds were tested in triplicate\nin a ten point stacked-plate dose response in concentrations diluted 1:2 beginning at 20 uM and\nending at 0.039 uM.  \nData Analysis: Thirty two control wells containing cells only  (Cell control) ,  twenty four wells\ncontaining cells and virus (Virus control) were included on each assay plate and used to calculate\nZ' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. And also eight wells\ncontaining cells, virus and control drug, Mycophenolic Acid at 5 uM were included on each assay\nplate. The average Z factor for the single dose campaign was 0.81. The percent inhibition of virus\ninduced cytopathic effect (CPE) was calculated as: 100*(Cmpd Lum - Median Virus Ctrl)/(Median Cell\nCtrl - Med Virus Ctrl). \"Hits\" in the single dose screen are those that show inhibition >= 3.42,\ndefined as 3*standard deviation (1.419) above the mean (-0.008) of the % inhibition of the\ncompounds in the full library screen. \n" ;

A probe that is selective against APJ (within equipotent range as\ndefined by a >10-fold difference in IC50) is desired.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus\nprovides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. This is\na luminescence assay based off of a kappa opioid cell line and beta-arrestin technology from\nDiscoveRx.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nidentification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay for agonists of\nNPY-Y1.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding\nbehavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation.\nImportantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY\nmediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors\n(GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have\nimplicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2),\nanxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling\n(6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and\ntumorigenesis (10). Therefore, the identification and characterization of small molecule modulators\nof NPY signaling and high affinity selective ligands for NPY receptors may prove useful for\nunderstanding NPY-associated human disease.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y1 potentiation dose response curves for compounds\nidentified as active in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1 (AID\n1304), \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of\nNPY-Y1\" (AID 1546),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID\n1359), and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (AID 1704).\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as a potentiator or agonist of NPY-Y1\nwill increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe\nfluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using\na 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2\nHEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed\ninto each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in\n0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was\nadded to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n- MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-100, for inactive 1-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel\ntherapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the\nintersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby\noffering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest,\nsince they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly\nactivate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nThe NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific\nmotifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce\nactivation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a\ngeneral bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria\n(S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M.\ntuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).\n Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in\ncells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing\nconvenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells.\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved\nin inflammatory responses. Recent studies have indicated that muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induction of\nhuman breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7 over-expressing NOD2 combined with small doses of\ncycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8 production and release (da Silva Correia, 2006; da\nSilva Correia 2007).\nMDP induced IL-8 production assay in MCF-7 cells is developed and performed to test if the primary\nand confirmed hits which putatively affect NOD2-mediated NF-kB pathway. Nod2 is a general sensor of\npeptidoglycan through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive\npeptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria (Girardin,2003). Here we used MDP to promote IL-8\nsecretion in MCF-7 cells.\nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nluminescence assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" (AID 1578) and followed\nup in \"SAR analysis of compounds that inhibit NOD1\" (AID 2072) to study the structure-activity\nrelationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial\nsources or synthesized internally.\nProtocol:  \n1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD2\n2. MDP-LD (Invivogen)\n3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)\n4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices)\nProtocol:\n1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added\ninto respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations.\n2. MDP was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ug/ml, to a culture medium suspension of MCF-7\ncells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter).\n3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC\n(5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours.\n4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit\nfrom BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences)\nwere coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium\ncarbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer\n(PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room\ntemperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of\nstandards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes,\n100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then\nsealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the\nplate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and\nabsorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular\nDevices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed.\n5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve\nanalysis.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "We have developed a 1536-well cell-based assay for quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS)\nagainst a number of cell lines to determine in vitro caspase 3/7 activity of small molecules. This\nparticular assay uses the N2a cell line which is derived from mouse neuroblastoma.\n\nThe Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7\nactivities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of\na peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is\nliberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent\nsignal is proportional to the amount of caspase 3/7 activity present.\nUsing the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the N2a cells\nwith complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was performed in\nopaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, staurosporine and doxorubicin were used as positive\ncontrols. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of caspase 3/7\nin the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a concentration-dependent\nmanner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% stimulation\n(10 uM staurosporine).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Trypanosoma brucei, the digenic protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in man,\nannually infects ~500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to 50,000-70,000 deaths per year. \nGlucose metabolism is essential for the parasite, with the pathogenic lifestage of the parasite,\nthe bloodstream form (BSF), acquiring energy exclusively through glycolysis.  \nHexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of the phosphoryl group of\nATP to glucose yielding glucose-6-phosphate.  Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that\nHK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is\nlethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been\nunsuccessful.  Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have\nbeen developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. \nT. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome\n10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical.  TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian\nHKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and\nhuman HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets.  Indeed, it has been suggested that the\npossibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote (Opperdoes and Michels,\n2001), and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long\nsought-after inhibitors a possibility. \n \nThus, a simple \"mix and read\" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of\nPittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening\nCenter Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the\nenzyme.  The TbHK1 assay was used to screen the NIH-SMR and the data has been posted on Pubchem. \nAll primary actives were then counter screened using the G6DPH counterscreen (coupled assay) to\nremove chemotypes that interfere with the assay format.  \nG6PDH counter-screening assay protocol\nThe basic screening procedure for the G6PDH HTS assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction\nmixture components (as follows):\n1.  15 uL of a 30 uM concentration of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final\nconcentration = 10 uM.)\n2.  15 uL of a G6P and NAD+ mixture is added for a final concentration of 0.2 mM and 0.6 mM,\nrespectively.\n3.  15 uL of G6PDH enzyme is added per well (final concentration = 0.006 mUnits/uL).\n4.  Reaction incubates for 1 hour at room temperature.\n5.  5 uL EDTA is added to each well (final concentration = 50 mM).\nThis assay was used as a counterscreen for the cherry picked compounds and was performed as a\nsingle concentration (10 uM).  These compounds were also rescreened in the primary TBHK1 screen at\na single concentration (10 uM).  ~212 compounds (out of 239) were available from DPI for subsequent\nfollow up. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for S1P4 agonists: Cell-based dose response high\nthroughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1509), and that confirmed activity in a set\nof experiments entitled, \"Confirmation Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the Sphingosine\n1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1523). This assay also serves as a counterscreen to\ndetermine whether these compounds are nonselective agonists due to activation of S1P1. This assay\nuses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor\nvia a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-\narrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of\na UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion\nprotein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated\nVP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression\nis monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable,\nfluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists\nwill activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point,\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 625,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or\nS1P (5 uM final concentration) prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA, was added to the appropriate\nwells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1\nul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol\nand containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room\ntemperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences,\nTurku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535\nnm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nActivation =100* ((Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control)/ (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing S1P.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\nactivation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were\nconsidered inactive.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on\ncellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological\ndisorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the\nprotein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with\nmisfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone\nDnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that\ninhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their\nimportance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel\nantibiotics. \nDnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa\nsubstrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638).\nIt has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of\nchaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good\ntarget for the small organic molecules.\nIn an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the\nsubstrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay, using a construct of DnaK corresponding\nto only the b-domain (residues 393-507), the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to\ndetermine their binding affinity to DnaK using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry.\n\nMaterials:\n1.  The gene coding for the E. coli DnaK substrate binding (beta) domain (393-507) was amplified\nwith PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites. The resulting protein\ncontains 17 extra amino acid residues (MGSSHHHHHHGLVPRGS) at the N-terminus. \n2.  The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified using\nNi2+ affinity chromatography.  \n3.  DnaK, human Hsp70, DnaJ, and GrpE were purchased from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI).\n4.  The model substrate NRLLLTG was synthesized by the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee,\nWI).  \nProtocols:\n1)  Titrations were done using a VP-ITC from MicroCal (Northampton, MA).\n2)  Full-length DnaK or SBD were used at 100 uM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and\n0.5-5% DMSO.\n3)  Compounds were used at 1-1.5 mM (10-15x protein concentration) in the same buffer.\n4) Compounds were also tested for their ability to affect the binding of the model substrate\nNRLLLTG.  Full-length DnaK was first titrated with a compound to saturation based on evolved heats.\n \n5)  The compound/DnaK(FL) complex was then titrated with model substrate NRLLLTG.  \n6)  Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software provided by the ITC manufacturer (MicroCal,\nNorthampton, MA).\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening\nassay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1).\n\nThe purpose of this assay was to determine antagonist activity of powder compounds against S1P1\nreceptor. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the\nGPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4\nmigrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic,\ncell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit\nS1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and\nBLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL\nof cell suspension to each well in 384-well plates, followed by overnight incubation at 37 C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% relative humidity. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample\nwells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in\n2% BSA (0.22 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were\nthen incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer\nFRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM\nProbenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark,\nplates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an\nexcitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm \nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nList of Reagents: \nTango EDG-1-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease was first characterized by Jean-Martin Charcot and Pierre Marie\nin France and, independently, by Howard Henry Tooth in England in 1886. CMT is one of the most\ncommon inherited neurological diseases, affecting about 125,000 Americans. CMT patients typically\nexhibit muscle atrophy in the extremities and sensory loss. The most common cause of CMT is known\nas CMT1A, and is caused by a duplication of the PMP22 gene, leading to over-expression of this\nprotein. PMP22 is a glycosylated intrinsic membrane protein accounting for 2-5% of the myelin\nprotein content and over-expression leads to demyelination and subsequently axonal loss. \nA cell-based assay for PMP22 expression modulation was developed by Drs. Ned Mantei and Ueli Suter\non behalf of the CMTA. This assay employs a mouse Schwann cell line, MSC80, \nthat was engineered to have the mouse Pmp22 promoter driving expression of a green light-emitting\nclick beetle luciferase (CBG68; Chroma-Gl developed by Promega Corp).  A red light-emitting click\nbeetle luciferase (CBR; developed by Promega Corp: CBG68 and CBR differ by only  a few amino acids\nwithin the D-luciferin binding pocket) under control of the EF-alpha promoter is also stably\nexpressed in the same cells for use as an internal control for nonspecific promoter- or\nreporter-based effects. \n\nCells were seeded in white solid 1536-well plates at between 500-750 cells/4uL in DMEM medium\ncontaining 10% FBS, w/o phenol red. After overnight incubation at 37 degree Celsius/5% C02, 23 nL\nof compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool, followed by 24h-incubation at 37\ndegree Celsius/5% C02. Then 4 uL Chroma-Glo luminescent substrate mix (Promega) was added to each\nwell. Luminescence was measured on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using a 540/25 nm filter\nfor green luminescence and a 618/8 nm filter for red luminescence. The green and red luminescent\nsignals were corrected for red and green luminescence filter overlap using filter calibration\nconstants (determined using control cell lines expressing either the green or red CBLuc reporters). \nThe %Activity was determined from the ratio of\ncorrected green/red luminescent values. Green luminescent and ratio %Activity was determined by\nnormalizing to the signal between of untreated cells (0% Activity)\n\nConcentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the green luminescence (PMP22\npromoter driven expression) and the red luminescence (control promoter) as well as the calculated\nratio. The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response\nmagnitude and degree of measured activity. \n" ;

As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\nTo measure NPY-Y2 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y2 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units. As designed, test compounds that increase probe fluorescence in Y2 cells are\nconsidered non-selective antagonists. Compounds were tested in triplicate.\n\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).

The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors of the ERK Signaling Pathway using a Homogeneous Screening Assay\n\nThe Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase\nsignaling pathway (ERK1/2 cascade) plays is a key role in transmitting signals from the cell\nsurface to the nucleus (Nishida and Gotoh 1993; Chang and Karin, 2001). The cascade is initiated by\nthe small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs.\nAlternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for\nhigh-throughput screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays\nconsisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of\ntarget for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The\ncompounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR\nmutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of\nthe prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other\nimportant ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1.\n\nThe HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR\nmutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled\nstreptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the\nsubstrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in\nhomogenous assay format.\nEGFR and EGFR\nmutants were obtained from Invitrogen. The assay buffer was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mM\nMgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.1 % NaN3, 0.1 % BSA and 0.1 mM orthovanadate.\nThe HTRF assays were preformed according to the HTRF Kinease TK kit. Optimization for each enzyme\nwas preformed in 384 well format (data not included).

        bat:hasParagraph  "The activity of DPM-DC was measured fluorometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the\nreactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated\nby the reduction of fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) due\nto the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize\ninterference by compounds that auto fluoresce under these conditions.\nA total of 76 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 50 uM. Compounds with\nmore than 20% inhibition at 50 uM were then tested in dose response assays at eight concentrations,\nranging from 100 uM to 0.625 uM depending on the % inhibition for each compound in the initial 50\nuM screen. To confirm that the compounds were specifically inhibiting DPM-DC and not one of the\nother enzymes in the assay, the compounds were tested in parallel in an assay that contained\nhexokinase as the enzyme instead of DPM-DC and glucose as the substrate instead of\ndiphosphomevalonate.  None of the compounds tested inhibited in this \"coupling enzymes\" assay.\nDiphosphomevalonate Decarboxylase Protocol for 0.5 mL Fluorescence Cuvet Assay \nPurified recombinant DPM-DC enzyme was provided by Dr. Thomas Leyh, Albert Einstein College of\nMedicine of Yeshiva University.\n236 uL of DPM-DC reagent mix which included NADH, diphosphomevalonate, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate,\nMgCl2, KCl, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in buffer was added to each 0.5 mL\nfluorescence cuvet. Compounds were then added to the cuvets in 4 uL volumes in DMSO. The reaction\nwas initiated with the addition of 160 uL of DPM-DC, diluted in assay buffer. The final\nconcentrations in the reaction were 0.02 mM NADH, 0.005 mM diphosphomelalonate, 4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM\nKCl, 0.4 mM ATP, 2 mM potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units/mL each of rabbit muscle pyruvate\nkinase and rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, 1% DMSO, and 30 nM DPM-DC enzyme diluted in 50 mM\nHEPES buffer (pH 7.8) in a final volume of 400 uL. The cuvets were immediately transferred to an\nAminco-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission\nwavelength = 460 nm) and reduction in fluorescence was measured for 3 minutes.  Each compound was\ntested in triplicate for the initial 50 uM screen and for the dose response assays each\nconcentration was in triplicate.  Full reaction controls were assays with 4 uL of DMSO added\ninstead of compound.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.\nRas family members (Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb among others) are\nrecognized their control of growth factor receptor signaling cascades.  When mutant or\nhyperactivated, Ras family members contribute contribute to ongogenesis.  The Ras-related GTPases\nare divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins\n(including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling,\nArf/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran\nprotein controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport.  Ran is the subject of an independent screening\ninitiative and Arf family members are membrane anchored via their N-termini\nin contrast to other family members, which are anchored via their C-termini. \nThis project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family members to validate the approach\nfor the identification of new chemical compounds with novel therapeutic potential in cell signaling\nand growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases.  Proper functioning of Ras and Ras-related GTPases is regulated at the\nlevel of localization and nucleotide binding and hydrolysis.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired\nGTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.\nPoint mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human\ndiseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho\nmutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP\nor due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date,\ninhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with\nvarious drugs affecting prenylation. \nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. \nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe assay described here is a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases are simultaneously screened against the MLSCN\nlibrary.  The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP.  The multiplex\nassay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set\nof six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion in the assay reported here.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01%\nNP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. \nBeads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke\nScientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied\nmagnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are\nlocated in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.   \nFlow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence\nemission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The\nresulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine\nthe compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated\nwith different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. \nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a\nwell.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. \nCompounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned\na PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for Rab7 there are only 69\nmissing compounds.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT) and the results from a fluorescent compound is considered to be\n'inconclusive' (PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 3, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0).  Assessment of\nfluorescent compound is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on all the\nproteins in one well.  Difference between Sample fluorescence and Positive Control fluorescence are\ncalculated for all the different proteins in a well.  The following equation describes this\ndifference (CompoundFLinRacWT) for RacWT;\nCompoundFLinRacWT = RacWTSampleFL - PCntrlRacWTFL \nwith RacWTSampleFL being the Sample fluorescence and PCntrlRacWTFL the Positive Control\nfluorescence of RacWT coated beads. Next, the coefficient of variation (CV) of all these CompoundFL\nfrom the different protein beads (RacWT, Rab7, RacACT, RasWT, Rab2, Cdc) in the same well are\ncalculated.  If the CV was less than 30%, meaning the compound attributed fluorescence was very\nsimilar between all the different proteins, then the compound was flagged as a potential\nfluorescent compound.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for Rab7 there are only 4,094 fluorescent\ncompounds.  There are 11 compounds out of these fluorescent compounds that have been labeled as\n\"Possible Red Fluorescent Compound\" due to a shift in events observed in the red fluorescent\nchannel (665 nm) that is utilized for distinquishing the different bead types.\nDue to potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends),\nnormalization is utilized to calculate the percent activity of the test compound.  Whole plate\ntrends of the positive controls are evaluated by linear regression.  Then due to the plate location\nof a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (notated with WPcalc) is utilized for calculating\n% activity normalized by whole plate:\n% Activity = 100 x (SampleFL - NCntrl)/(PCntrl_WPcalc -NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are Median Fluorescence Intensity associated with the bead set bound with a\nspecific protein.  SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, PCntrl_WPcalc is the\nwell-specific, calculated value based on whole plate linear regression of wells without test\ncompounds, and NCntrl is for measurement in presence 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP.  Baseline of % Activity\nis 100%.\nMaximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 was given for the primary screening.  The absolute difference\nbetween baseline and %Activity was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE:\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = |100% - %Activity|\nA compound was considered \"Active\" if the change in %Activity was greater than 20% from baseline\n(i.e., PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE >=20%).  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for \"Active\" and\n1 for \"Non-active\".   \nFor \"Active\" compounds, the type of activity is indicated in column entitled \"ActivityType\". \n\"Inhibitor\" is a compound with <80% Activity and \"Activator\" is a compound with >120% Activity.\nAverage Zprime for this screen was 0.85 +/- 0.04.\n" ;

This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express\nthe human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 1 (EDG1; S1P1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription\nfactor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein\nand a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation\nof the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through\nproteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus,\nwhere it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA\nsubstrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase\nwell FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a\nnominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth\nmedia consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM\nNEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200\nug/mL Zeocin, 50 ug/mL Hygromycin, and 100 ug/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 275,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 uL\nof cell suspension to each well of a 384 well plate (10,000 cells/well), followed by overnight\nincubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final\nDMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (40 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA\nwas added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After\nthe incubation, 2.2 uL/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells.

Prior to\nnormalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels (ie,\nfluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay\ndata, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm / I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported\nEC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50%\nactivation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50\nuM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than\n50 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive.

Compounds that cause\na reduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening\nline to eliminate false positive hits due to non-specific RNA stem-loop binding. Assays were\nconducted in 384-well format (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well. \nCompounds were tested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25\nmM to 24 uM, while final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.\nCells were grown for 48 h, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min and 30 uL Steady-Glo\n(Promega, E2250) reagent was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min,\nand luciferase levels were measured.\n \n1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the Prion protein (PRP) 5'UTR-Luciferase gene\nfusion were grown to confluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza,\n12-614Q) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM\npenstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD\nFalcon, 353112) in a TC incubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h).\n2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro,\n25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95%\nhumidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This\n10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3\nmin at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was\nresuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below).\n3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing\n72 h for cells to grow to confluency.\n4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media\nprewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles.\n5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50\nuL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized\ndispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood.\n6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an offline Liconic\n(STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight.\n7) Screening was performed using walk-up instrumentation.

        bat:hasParagraph  "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the\norexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; Hcrtr1)\nactivity. This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO\ncells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor\nsignals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1\nproduction. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based\ndetection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds,\nlabeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy\ntransfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R\nactivation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the\nlabeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds\nthat act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1\nproduction, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased\ninteractions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET.\nCompounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 6.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask.

Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis\nbuffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds\nand plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After\nexcitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm\nbandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate\nreader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I671nm / I618nm\nWhere:\nI671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm.\nI618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618nm.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 -( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. \nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. \nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\nCHO-K1 cells stably transfected with rat M1, human M2/Gqi5, human M3, rat M4/Gqi5, or human M5 were\nloaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed\nand replaced with assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with\n20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final\n2X stock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration\nof 0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition\nto assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II\n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated\nwith test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine. \nCells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude\nwas first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine.\nEC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using\nstandard non-linear regression (variable slope).\nThese compounds had EC50s less than 10 micromolar for the muscarinic M5 receptor in the calcium\nflux assay, and therefore, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. Compound SID 85285464 had no\nselectivity preference for M5 compared to the other subtypes and was assigned 'Score' of '50'.\nCompound SID 85285486 was more than 60-fold selective for M5 over the other subtypes, and thus\nassigned a 'Score' of '100'.\n" ;

TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and\nits ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including\ndepression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically\nstable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of\nbrain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development\nof drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders.\nUpon TRHR-Gq activation in TRHR cells, intracellular calcium is released from stores in the\nendoplasmic reticulum.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and\nreversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel\nresearch tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal.\nThis assay is a follow-up to \"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the APJ  receptor \nvia a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 2520.\nA.

This\nparticular assay uses the mesangial cell line which is derived from normal human renal glomeruli.\n\nThe Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7\nactivities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of\na peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is\nliberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent\nsignal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present.\nUsing the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the mesangial\ncell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was\nperformed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as\npositive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of\ncaspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only)\nand 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response\ndata modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput dose response assay for\ninhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide.\n\nCancer initialization and survival depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis)\nmachinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although an effective mechanism for\nanti-cancer chemotherapeutics is apoptosis induction, cancer cells develop resistance to the\npro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). Multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic\nlymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) are two well-characterized lymphoid cancers (3). Bcl-2 is an\noncoprotein activated in these lymphomas, and serves to inhibit apoptosis induced by many cytotoxic\ncompounds. Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are regulated by protein-protein interactions,\nforming homo- and heterodimers (4, 5). One of these proteins, MCL1, is essential for survival of\nhuman MM cells (6). MCL1 and other Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xl share Bcl-2's ability to oppose\napoptosis, as well as sequence homology in 4 a-helical Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1-BH4 (3). As\na result, these proteins are promising targets for studies on tumor initiation, progression and\napoptosis resistance. Research showing that MCL1 opposes cell death (7), is highly expressed in\nhematopoetic stem cells and is regulated by growth factors (8), and that inhibiting Bcl-2\nprotein-protein interactions via the crucial BH3 domain is a valid approach to cancer drug\ndevelopment (2, 9, 10), suggest that targeted therapies for MCL1 are needed. The identification of\nselective inhibitors of MCL1 will provide useful tools for the study of lymphoid tumorigenesis, and\nelucidate mechanisms for apoptosis induction in resistant cancers.\n\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin a set of previous experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical\nhigh throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1)\ninteractions with BIM-BH3 peptide\" (AID 2057), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput confirmation assay for\ninhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide (AID 2168).\nThis biochemical assay monitors binding of the BH3 domain of the Bcl-2 family member, Bim, to the\nbinding pocket of human MCL1. In this fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay, GST-MCL1 fusion\nprotein is incubated with FITC-BH3-Bim peptides, in the presence of test compounds. Binding of\npeptide to MCL1 target protein increases the effective molecular mass of the peptide, slowing its\nrotation and increasing millipolarization (mP) units in the well. As designed, compounds that\ninhibit MCL1 will prevent binding of Bim peptide to MCL1, and increase the proportion of free to\nbound peptides, thereby reducing mP in the well. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point,\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 109 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35\n0.001%) containing 9.2 nM GST-MCL1 were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test\ncompound in DMSO, unlabeled Bim-BH3 control peptide (0.770 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO\nalone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 8.0 nanomolar FITC-BH3-Bim peptide in assay\nbuffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) into all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20\nminutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux\nmicroplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic\nmirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 595nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds\nfor each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value\n(mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\nPercent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) / ( median_\nPositive_Control_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing unlabeled Bim-BH3 peptide.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 109 micromolar) did\nnot result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 109\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-88, for inactive compounds 87-0.\nList of Reagents:\nGST-MCL-1 enzyme (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFITC-BH3-Bim peptide (supplied by Assay Provider)\nUnlabeled BH3-Bim peptide (supplied by Assay Provider)\n1536-well plates (Corning, part 3864)\nDulbecco's PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, part D8537)\nBrij 35 (Sigma-Aldrich, part B4184)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Confirmation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Agonists.\n\nTSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland\nwhich belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a\nseven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s)\nprotein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5'\nmonophosphate (cAMP). The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and\nregulates their growth and function. Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with\nthyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after\nsurgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small\nmolecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and\nphysiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings. However, no selective small\nmolecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists has\never been reported.\nIn order to confirm specificity of the compounds to the TSHR, a  confirmatory assay was conducted\non a similar family member, the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) receptor, transfected into a HEK 293 cell\nline, using an orthogonal detection technology to measure cAMP stimulation: antibody-based\nHomogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF).

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions \n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \n\nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by\nproject collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that\nare labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30\nnanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom\nexcitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a\nsingle bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0\nsupplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing.\nThe 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below)\nare centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50\nmilliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then\nresuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated\nwork station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10\nminutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10\nmilliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds\nRGS proteins with high affinity.\nThis design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is\nassociated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead\nsets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635\nnm. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7\nmight be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead\nsets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into\n384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead\ncontrol (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a\nfluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the\ntest compounds.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters\n(5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test\ncompound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is\n10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test\ncompound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are\nincubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for\neach well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of\n218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds.\nRGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of\nthe measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative\ncontrol bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that\nparticular protein is \"inconclusive\", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive\n(see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS\nProtein is \"inconclusive\", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant\namounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702\ncompounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. \nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound\n(|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or\ninhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the\ntarget RGS-Galphao interaction. \nRV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and\nRGS7, compounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8,\ncompounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library\ndependent \"edge effect\" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the\ndata set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered \"Active\". Data from compounds\nlocated in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than\n0 or greater than 135 were considered \"Active\". Active compounds include both activators - where\n%Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the\n218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as\npotential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per\nprotein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are\nRGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific.\nRGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel,\nwhich can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has\nthe lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest\nbead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead\nset, the compound is flagged as \"Potential Red Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as\npotential red fluorescent compounds.\nThe Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library,\naverage Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when\nexcluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard\ndeviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for\ntarget RGS16, due to the library dependent \"edge effect\", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68\nstandard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity\nof the protein.\nFor easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the\nsame compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an\nactivator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column\nRi_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where \"i\" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses) are important human and/or animal pathogens that cause acute\nvirus infections with severe diseases and/or death. Several recent human and/or animal epidemics\nhave been caused by arboviruses, including Dengue virus (DNV) in South America and Asia, West Nile\nvirus (WNV) in North America and Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe.  Commercially available vaccines\nare not available for many arboviruses and those that are available are frequently not 100%\nefficacious.  For example, there is no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against\nWNV, which is spreading across the US.  The commercial Dengue vaccine has been under development\nfor decades and still is not effective against all strains of Dengue viruses.  This was recently\nseen when a new strain of Dengue III spread through South America causing sever disease and death. \n So for many arbovirus based diseases, there is no effective vaccine or chemotherapy currently\navailable.  The need to develop antiviral drugs is critical in treating and managing disease.  BTV\nwas selected as a prototype virus from this genus for use in developing a High Throughput Screening\nprotocol.  It was selected because it is not pathogenic in humans, which reduces the risk\nassociated with assay development using infectious agents.  \nTo screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format.  The assay\nmeasures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in BSR cells by BTV infection using cell viability as the\nend point.   The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by BTV infection involves challenging 5000\ncells with BTV virus at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The BTV-10\nvirus stock was prepared on July 10, 2007 from BSR cells. The assay includes both cell and virus\ncontrols and cell survival was measured 72 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability\nreagent (Promega). Cell viability was determined from intracellular ATP concentration using firefly\nluciferase as the reporter. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values\nof the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x\n100. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. \nCell Culture: BSR cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5% FBS. The cells are\nmaintained at 37OC, 5.0% CO2 to 90% confluence. Prior to cell plating, cells were re-suspended in\nDMEM with 100ug/L streptomycin, 100 IU Penicillin/L, 4mM L-glut and 1% FBS (Assay Media). \nBTV virus culture: The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared in BSR cells using a stock available in Dr.\nQianjun Li's laboratory. Briefly, BSR cells were grown in four T75 plates to 90% confluence, and\n5ml of BTV-10 virus at 105pfu/ml was then added to the culture media. After three days incubation,\ncells and the supernatant were harvested and the cells were pelleted.  The cell pellet was\nre-suspended in 20 ml media, and sonicated. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10\nminutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80 OC. These virus stocks\nwere titrated in BSR cells using the TCID50 method. The titer was 1 X 108 TCID50/ml. \nControl and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and\n5ul was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue\nculture treated plates.  Test compounds were diluted in media to 60uM with a DMSO concentration of\n0.6%.  5ul was also dispensed to the assay plate.\n  \nCell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 5000 cells/well\nwere plated in 15uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were then transferred to the Virology HTS lab\nand incubated 2-4 hrs at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity.\nVirus Addition: BTV was diluted in media to 5,000 pfu/ml and 10ul was added to the compound wells\nand the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.01).  Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell\ncontrol wells.  All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety\nCabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated for 72 h within the BSL-2\nlaboratory.\nEndpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an\nequal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well.  Plates were incubated\nfor 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision\nmulti-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-2\nfacility. \n" ;

This assay were carried out to assess the mechanism of\naction for this compound in the condition of nascent nucleotide depletion with Mg buffer.\nThe protein target (GST-Cdc42, 4 microM) is bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C.\nProtein on GSH-beads is depleted of nascent nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA-containing\nbuffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% detergent, NP-40, containing HPS\nbuffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM MgCl2, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.\nBinding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-CDC42-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min\nwith 1 milliM MgCl2 and either DMSO or 10 microM compound and subsequently adding 50 microL of\nvarying concentration (range 0-1000 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent\nnucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter\nand fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to\ndetermine the median fluorescence per bead population. Non-specific binding of the BODIPY-GTP were\nassessed in the presence of excess non-fluorescent GTP (10 microM). \n \nCalculations:\nThe specific binding of fluorescent GTP (SpecMCF) were calculated from the median values measured\nat different fluorescent GTP concentrations in the presense of blocking non-fluorescent GTP\n(RawMCFwNFGTP) and DMSO (RawMCFwDMSO):\nSpecMCF = RawMCFwDMSO - RawMCFwNFGTP\nThese specific binding values were then fit to an One site binding (hyperbola) equation:\nBoundGTP = Bmax * [GTP]/(Kd + [GTP])\nwhere BoundGTP is the bound fluorescent GTP, [GTP] is the concentration of fluorescent GTP in\nnanoM, Bmax is the calculated value of maximum binding sites for GTP, and Kd is the observed\naffinity of GTP to the guanine nucleotide binding protein under those conditions.\n \nPUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the comparison of the different extimates of Bmax in the presense of DMSO\nor 10 microM inhibitory compound. Thus PUBCHEM_SCORE = 100 *(BmaxDMSO-BmaxCmpd)/BmaxDMSO where\nBmaxDMSO is the Bmax calculated in the presense of DMSO and BmaxCmpd is the Bmax calculated in\npresense of 10 microM inhibitory compound.

Tested\nwere 34 compounds that exhibited an inhibition constant (Ki) of less than 10 microM in at least one\nFPR ligand-binding dose response experiment. The assay determines the ability of each test compound\nto prevent the rise in intracellular ionized calcium elicited by the FPR peptide agonist, fMLFF. \nThe assay was performed in low throughput mode in a flow cytometer.\n\nCalcium response experiments were done as previously described with minor modifications. \nU937 cells expressing FPR were resuspended in warm tissue culture\nmedium (10^7 cells in 10 milliL) containing 200 nanoM Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes,\nEugene, OR) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, with mixing every 10 minutes.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors\ntransduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of\ninflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2). STATs are activated in\nresponse to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases\n(1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are\nphosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear\ntranslocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although\nstructurally similar, members of the STAT family (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse\nbiological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative,\nwhile STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible\nfor mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling\n(4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered\nto have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Currently available STAT1 modulators mediate modest\neffects on STAT-induced transcription, act indirectly by targeting JAK or other kinases activities,\nor are associated with adverse hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects (6, 7).  The\nliabilities of the current state of the art for STAT1 modulators necessitate the discovery of\nhigher affinity probes.  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT\nsignaling, the identification of selective modulators of STAT1 activity may lead to pharmacological\ntools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as\nactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening\nassay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (PubChem AID 920). The compounds selected for testing in this\nAID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 920; 2) they were\ndeclared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput\nscreening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition\" (PubChem AID 862).\nIn this assay inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line\ncell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for\ntheir ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells\nwere exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase\nactivity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 antagonist will block\nIFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the\nluciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence.\n\nThe STAT1 antagonist and potentiator confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells\nwere grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v\nfetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C\nin an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of well-mixed\ncell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The\nassay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal\nconcentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (final\nnominal IC100 concentration of 300 uM, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells\nreceived DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration).  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37\ndegrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80\nconcentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into sample and all control\nwells.  Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was\nstopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well,\nfollowed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the\nViewLux plate reader.\n" ;

Here we use an adapted 384-well cell-based assay that measures cytopathic effect (CPE)\ninduced in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by influenza virus infection, using a\nluminescent-based detection system for signal endpoint (1).  The HTS for inhibitors of the CPE\nexerted by H5N1 involves challenging MDCK cells with H5N1 virus at an MOI of 0.005 in the presence\nof the compounds to be screened. H5N1 has been constructed by reverse genetics and its\nsusceptibility to ribavirin has been verified. The virus has been used to infect chicken eggs to\nyield allantoic fluid for use as a source of H5N1 in the HTS. The assay is carried out in 384-well\nplates with appropriate controls and cell survival is measured after 72 h using the Promega\nCellTiterGlo reagent, which measures cell viability in terms of cellular ATP concentration detected\nwith firefly luciferase. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of\nthe virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100.\nLibrary compounds were screened at 50 uM. To follow up on single dose #hits# (>25% CPE inhibition)\nfrom the primary assay, these compounds will be evaluated in more detail by measuring their\nantiviral activity, cell toxicity, and selectivity.

It had\nbeen shown that this region forms a stem loop which is, in turn, a significant regulator of the APP\nlevels in the brain (1, 2). The effects of compounds addition on APP levels is measured by\nquantification of luciferase expression levels with a bioluminescence assay system.

        bat:hasParagraph  "BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH)\nfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB). These proteases reverse the conjugation of ubiquitin to\ntargeted proteins. The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular processes suggests a\ncritical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological conditions. In order to\nconfirm the activity of hit compounds from the primary assay, an HPLC-based, end-point enzyme\nactivity assay was developed. The assay monitors the hydrolysis of a simple ubiquitin conjugate\n(Ub-ethyl ester) by BAP1, leading to the release of free Ub.  After the reaction is quenched, the\namounts of both Ub and UbEE present are quantified by reverse-phase HPLC.  The ratio of Ub and UbEE\npeak heights was used to determine % conversion (i.e. the conversion of UbEE to Ub), which reflects\nBAP1 activity.   \n\n10x assay buffer buffer (1x = 50 mM Tris HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5)\nPurified BAP1 (provided by investigator) \nUb-ethyl ester (UbEE) substrate (2.2 mg/mL, provided by investigator)\nTest compounds (1 mM in 100% DMSO)\n400 mM HCl\nReaction procedure:\n1.

Purified Ub and UbEE were used as retention time controls.\nData analysis: \nRetention time, peak height, and peak area were determined for both Ub and UbEE using UniPoint\nsoftware v. 5.11 (Gilson).  \nCompounds with Ub/UbEE peak height ratio >125% were discarded (7 total compounds).  These compounds\nare labeled as inactive.\nFor each compound, % conversion was determined based on peak heights:\n% conversion =  [Ub/(Ub+UbEE)] * 100\nWhere appropriate, chromatograms were analyzed by hand to confirm results or if a potential hit had\nbeen overlooked because of integration program settings.  Peak area data has been omitted for these\nsamples.\nFor each compound, % control was calculated as the ratio of the compound % conversion to the mean %\nconversion for the plate.\nCompounds with % control less than or equal to 60% were identified as active.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was obtained by normalizing the % conversion values obtained between 100 and\n0, with 100 corresponding to the lowest % conversion, and 0 to the highest % conversion, according\nto the formula:\nSCORE = 100 * (1-((Value - LowestConversion) / (HighestConversion - LowestConversion)))\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands\n\n\nThe assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a\nhigh-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1. The assay was performed in a \"duplex\"\nformat in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL)\ncell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a\nred-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells\nduring flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the\npeptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with\nhigh affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were\ndetermined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the\nduplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. \nPreviously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR)\nwere screened to identity FPR ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID\n520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary\nintracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule\nFPRL1 antagonists. Two major chemotype families representing the most potent FPR ligands\n(inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure activity\nrelationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of computational\nscreening techniques (2D substructure search)to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv collection of more\nthan 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased and screened in a primary HTS FPRL-FPRL1\nduplex assay, results of which have been reported separately. There were 13 compounds that\nsatisfied hit selection criteria in the primary HTS assay (> 30% inhibition of fluorescent ligand\nbinding). These were tested in a dose response format in the FPR-FPRL1 duplex assay to confirm\nactivity and determine potency. \nThe FPRL1 dose response assay results are reported here. The FPR dose response assay results\nobtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately and represent counter-screen\ndata with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity\nidentified in this report.\n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\n\nThe purpose of this experiment was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M5 receptor\nfor their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. NMS acts as a\ncompetitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.\nExperimental Protocol:\nMembranes were prepared from M5-expressing CHO cells as described [5]. Binding reactions contained\n0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 micrograms of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define\ntotal binding) or 1 micromolar atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500\nmicroliters. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially\ndiluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to\ngive a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated\nfor 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions\nwere stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1 micrometer\npore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl,\n0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount\nscintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity\nexperiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and\npresence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30 micromolar, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS\nconcentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction.\nRadioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less.\nData Fitting:\nData from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum\nspecific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and\nfitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no\nweighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30\nmicromolar did not fit a  full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive\nstatistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and\nthe 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'\n" ;

Since the\npositive control agonist, GW1929, exhibited time resolved-fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET)\nactivity only after several hours of incubation with the SRC-2/PPARgamma complex, a sample well\nthat exhibited TR-FRET activity immediately after initiation of the SRC-2/PPARgamma assay most\nlikely was the result of format-specific artefact. Therefore, this assay's specific purpose is to\nidentify sample wells that possess this artefact, thus indicating that compounds in those wells may\nhave an erroneous activity assignment in AID 1032.\nThis assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion\nprotein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-2 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each\nrecognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG\nAllophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  A high ratio in sample well measured immediately\nafter addition of compound suggests TR-FRET assay format artefact.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium\nFluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered\nat 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining\n46 columns were filled with five ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST\nEuK, 3 ug/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC-2\nprotein [aa 624-829].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was\nstarted by dispensing forty nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM\nfinal nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. \nImmediately after centrifugation fluorescence was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading\nfluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin\nElmer).  Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well,\naccording to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000\nWhere,\n I671 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617 nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617 nm.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally fluorescent compounds.\nTwo values were calculated: (1) the average Ratio of all compounds tested, and (2) three times\ntheir standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter.  Any compound\nthat exhibited greater fluorescence than the cutoff parameter was flagged as a possible TR-FRET\nartefact. \nList of Reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part 71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC-2 protein [aa 624-829] (produced by Dr. Scott Busby, Scripps Florida).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen for agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based high-throughput dose\nresponse assay for agonists of NPY-Y1.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of\nfeeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional\nregulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and\nalcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor,\na 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production.\nNPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus\nsolitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile\nand biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is\npredicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission,\nY2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this\nhypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type\ncontrols (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress\nethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure\nand high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6).\nTherefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID 1359), \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators of NPY-Y2:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID 1710),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID\n1304), and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (PubChem AID 1703), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y1.\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of NPY-Y1 will increase Y1\nactivity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence,\nthus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point,\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into\neach well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added\nto the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n- MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-78, for inactive compounds 76-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Assay:  Dense granule release of platelet-rich plasma (PRP).  Expired units of PRP obtained from\nvarious blood centers were plated in 384-well white assay plates (Aurora, 00030721) on average of\n15,600,000 platelets/well in 20ul.  PRP was exposed to 7.5uM compounds from the MLPCN collection or\nvarious doses of the positive control, Cilostazol (Sigma #C0737, Lot# 042K4704,\nBRD-K67017579-001-04-2 ) for 30 minutes prior to addition of the thrombin receptor (Par1) activator\nSFLLRN (5uM, Bachem, H-8365) and detection reagent CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G755) using a modified\nprotocol, for measurement of ATP released from the dense granules.  PBS is used in place of\nCellTiter-Glo Buffer thus preventing platelet lysis and a high background of ATP.  Luminescence\nmeasurements are taken 15 minutes after reagent addition.\nOutcome:  A decrease in the luminescent signal will identify compounds that either inhibit the\nrelease of dense granules from the platelets, or inhibit the luciferase enzyme.  Normalization of\nthe HTS data across runs and calibration to the positive was performed as described below.  The\nresults are reported as % inhibition.  Specificity for platelet inhibition will be determined in a\nsecondary assay. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein (F/P ratio between 2 and 3, supplied by\nproject collaborator). Six bead sets are used, including one unlabeled bead set and five sets that\nare labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence that are fluorescent in PE-Cy5 (680/30\nnanom), APC (665/20 nanom) and APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 488 nanom or 635 nanom\nexcitation (Spherotech product numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a\nsingle bio-RGS protein by mixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0\nsupplemented with 0.1% BSA). The mixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing.\nThe 5 bead sets (each with a bound protein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below)\nare centrifuged separately, washed once in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50\nmilliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then\nresuspended in FB and stored on ice until the plates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated\nwork station. Before incubation with bead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10\nminutes at room temperature in AMF buffer (50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10\nmilliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces the activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4- complex that binds\nRGS proteins with high affinity.\nThis design allows all 5 RGS proteins to be assayed in one multiplex, since each bead set is\nassociated with a unique optical address that is also coupled to a unique RGS protein. The bead\nsets are distinguished by distance emission characteristics at 750+ nanom with excitation at 635\nnm. For instance, bio-RGS4 might be noncovalently coupled to red level 1 beads, whereas bio-RGS7\nmight be coupled to red level 2 beads, and so forth. After preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead\nsets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further diluted in FB, combined and loaded into\n384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling workstation. The streptavidin-only bead\ncontrol (no associated bio-RGS protein) is incorporated into each well as a scavenger as well as a\nfluorescence indicator to resolve inherent fluorescent properties (at 530 nanom emission) of the\ntest compounds.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of 10.1 microliters\n(5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1 microliters of test\ncompound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test compound concentration is\n10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test\ncompound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are\nincubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for\neach well. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and no PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is assigned. In this set of\n218,702 compounds, there are only 252 missing compounds.\nRGS proteins from different batches exhibit different Galphao binding capacity. When the mean of\nthe measured MCF from the positive control beads is less than 2 times the mean of the negative\ncontrol bead set, and very close to the signal from the Scavenger bead set, the results for that\nparticular protein is \"inconclusive\", thus the target protein in that plate is considered Inactive\n(see column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of an Inactive RGS\nProtein is \"inconclusive\", and a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 is automatically assigned. Significant\namounts of inactive protein RGS19 and RGS7 were found in this multiplexing assay.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound. In this set of 218,702\ncompounds, 456 of them were flagged as potentially fluorescent. \nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound\n(|%Reg|), where |%Reg| is the absolute value of RV minus 100. The maximum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of\n100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater than 100, meaning 100% activation or\ninhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the substance has no impact on the\ntarget RGS-Galphao interaction. \nRV cutoff rates were employed to determine the activity of test compounds. For targets RGS4 and\nRGS7, compounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 50; for target RGS8,\ncompounds were considered \"Active\" if the |%Reg| was greater than 40. Due to a compound library\ndependent \"edge effect\" phenomena, target RGS16 was analyzed differently. For the majority of the\ndata set, compounds with a |%Reg| of greater than 75 were considered \"Active\". Data from compounds\nlocated in rows A and P of 504 plates were assigned a special filter (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT), and only those with RV minus 100 (not absolute value of %Reg) less than\n0 or greater than 135 were considered \"Active\". Active compounds include both activators - where\n%Reg is positive - and inhibitors - where %Reg is negative (see column titled ACTIVITY). From the\n218,702 screened compounds, a total of 1908 compounds were chosen for further investigation as\npotential regulators of all multiplexed RGS proteins. Approximately 700-800 hit compounds per\nprotein target (~0.3% hit rate) were identified. Of those, 63 compounds are RGS4 specific, 48 are\nRGS7 specific, 179 are RGS8 specific and 399 are considered RGS16 specific.\nRGS bead populations are distinguished using the mean channel fluorescence from FL9 (red) channel,\nwhich can potentially be affected by red fluorescent compounds, especially the bead set that has\nthe lowest FL9 intensity. When there are significantly more events detected from the second dimmest\nbead set then the rest of the bead set, and less than 25 events are detected for the dimmest bead\nset, the compound is flagged as \"Potential Red Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). In this set of 218,702 compounds, only four compounds were flagged as\npotential red fluorescent compounds.\nThe Z prime score for the plates are listed in column titled Z_Prime_Value. For the entire library,\naverage Z prime score for target RGS4 is 0.72, with a 0.2 standard deviation; for target RGS7, when\nexcluding inactive proteins, Z prime score is 0.72 (0.12 for the complete library), the standard\ndeviation is 0.18; for target RGS8, Z prime score is 0.72 and standard deviation is 0.19; for\ntarget RGS16, due to the library dependent \"edge effect\", the Z prime score is 0.3 with a 0.68\nstandard deviation; and for target RGS19, Z prime score is off limit because of the poor activity\nof the protein.\nFor easy user indexing, the PubChem Activity Scores (see column titled Ri_ACTIVITY_SCORE) for the\nsame compound on other targets as well as comments about whether the compound is an\nactivator/inhibitor to target RGSi, and whether target RGSi is an Inactive target (see column\nRi_ASSAY_COMMENT) are also included in the file, where \"i\" can be 4, 7, 8, 16, or 19.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Chronic pain (neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, cancer pain) is a major health problem.\nOpiate-based drugs, such as morphine and morphine derivatives, are the primary standard of care for\nthe treatment of chronic pain.  Unfortunately, patients develop tolerance to opiates due to\ndesensitization of the opiate receptor.  Thus, alternative anti-nociceptive (\"pain killing\")\npathways need to be explored for treatment of chronic pain. \nThe N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV2.2s) in dorsal root ganglia neurons is a well validated\ntarget for chronic pain (1, 2). We previously demonstrated the interaction between CaV2.2 and the\nfirst PDZ domain of molecular adaptor protein Mint1 (3). In additional experiments we demonstrated\nthat carboxyl-terminal association of CaV2.2 protein with the Mint1-PDZ domain plays an important\nrole in synaptic targeting and function of N-type Ca2+ channels (4). \nThe following describes a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF)\nHTS assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of association between Mint1-PDZ domains and N-type\nCa2+ channel carboxyl-terminal peptide (NC peptide). Compounds that disrupt the interaction would\nresult in decrease of TR-FRET ratio and are detected in the assay. Small molecules identified in\nthe screening would serve as useful probes for studies of synaptic function of N-type Ca2+\nchannels, its validation as a therapeutic target and/or as starting point for development of\nanti-nociceptive therapeutic agents with novel mechanism of action. \n\nAssay materials:\n1) Biotin, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein (GST-M15) and biotinylated (biotin-)\nN-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl-terminal peptide (biotin-NC peptide) corresponding to the\ncarboxyl-terminal tail of CaV2.2 protein were supplied by assay provider.\n2) Anti-GST monoclonal antibody labeled with europium cryptate (EuK-anti-GST-mAb (CisBio cat#\n61GSTKLB) and streptavidin-XL665 (CisBio cat# 610SAXLB ).\n3) Potassium Fluoride (KF)  (Aqua Solutions cat# P3901)\n4) Tween-20 (Sigma cat# 9416)\n5) Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma cat# A7888)\nWorking solutions:\n1.

The assay was performed in a \"duplex\"\nformat in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL)\ncell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1.  The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a\nred-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells\nduring flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the\npeptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with\nhigh affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were\ndetermined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the\nduplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.  \n\nThe primary high throughput screening (HTS) assay was performed in 384 well format.  Test compounds\nwere assessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand\nbinding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from\nFPRL1.  \n\nThe FPR primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported\nseparately (AID 440) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and\nspecificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report.  Likewise, FPRL1\nbinding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity\nand specificity of compounds identified to have FPR binding activity in the FPR primary HTS assay\nreport (AID 440).\n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines \n(10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded\nbreaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer,\ngenetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible\nfor repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor\nsuppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in\nanti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is\nessential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer\ntherapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search\nfor homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step\nof HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and\nstimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions.\nOur goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as\nchemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer\ntherapies.\nDNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51\nprotein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this\nassay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides\n(47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm\nand the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1\n(BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with\nthe sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary\noligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the\nphoton emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an\nincrease in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the\nduplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA\nstrand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein\nfilament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the\nfluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this\nfluorescence.\nWe have completed the HTS on ~200000 compounds (AID 1385). Hits identified were ordered from DPI\nand their dose-response was carried out (AID 1435). 19 compounds showed a good dose-response. To\nconfirm selectivity of these compounds a DNA binding assay was carried out to rule out the effect\nof DNA intercalation by these compounds. Compounds that show a negative result in the DNA binding\nassay can be taken to be Rad51 inhibitors and further confirmatory tests will be carried out. Here\nwe report results of the DNA binding assay.\nMaterials\nds DNA was provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence assay was carried out in 384-well\nblack, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676).

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\nAgents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\n(mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving\ncognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with\nthese agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients\nwith AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist,\nxanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that\nmAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from\nschizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders.\nEvidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1\nmAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have\nfailed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects\nassociated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective\ncompounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical\neffects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable\ncandidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects.\nPrevious attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other\nspecific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and\ndifficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major\nadvances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding\nsite [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be\nhighly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective\nagonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor\nrather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and\nprovide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4].\n\nThe purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest for their ability to modulate calcium\nflux in a cell line expressing the Y381A mutant M1 receptor.\n\nStable CHO-K1 cell lines expressing rat Y381A mutant M1 receptor were plated into 96-well Costar\noptical bottom assay plates at a concentration of 70K cells/well in 100 microliters of Ham's F-12\nmedia.   Cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C (5% CO2).  The following day, medium was\nremoved from cells and they were incubated in 50 microliters of Fluo-4 AM diluted in assay buffer\n(HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) for 1 hour at 37 degrees C.  Dye was\nremoved and replaced with 45 microliters of assay buffer.  Test compounds were serially diluted in\nDMSO-matched assay buffer at 2X concentration and 45 microliters was applied to a cell-containing\nassay plate in an automated format using the Flexstation (Molecular Devices).  Calcium flux was\nmeasured over time as an increase in fluorescence (fold over basal), and the max minus min values\nfor each well were copied into a custom excel template, which normalized the data as a % of maximum\nresponse elicited by a high concentration of N-desmethyl-clozapine (NDMC).  This data was then\ncopied into Prism (version 4.0c), which fit the data to a sigmoidal dose-response model with\nvariable slopes using no constraints or weighting.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor \n\nTSH is an alpha/beta heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary gland\nwhich belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family. The actions of TSH are mediated by a\nseven-transmembrane receptor, which upon TSH binding couples preferentially to the G-alpha (s)\nprotein (Gs), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increase in cyclic adenosine 3', 5'\nmonophosphate (cAMP).  The TSH receptor (THSR) is mainly expressed in thyroid follicular cells and\nregulates their growth and function.  Recombinant TSH is used to activate TSHR in patients with\nthyroid cancer receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy and to screen for residual tumor after\nsurgery, but it is expensive and must be administered intramuscularly. An orally active small\nmolecule TSHR agonist would serve as an invaluable research tool for studying TSHR pharmacology and\nphysiology, and would have multiple advantages in therapeutic settings.  However, no selective\nsmall molecule agonist of the TSH receptor exists, and no small molecule screen for TSHR agonists\nhas ever been reported.\n\nThis cell based assay utilized a cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNG) as a biosensor for cAMP\ninduction by potential TSHR agonists.\n\nTSHR cell line \nHEK 293 cells stably expressing the TSHR as well as a modified CNG were purchased from BD\nbiosciences. Stimulation of cAMP production causes the CNG to open and subsequent membrane\ndepolarization to occur. A fluorescent membrane potential dye (BD biosciences) was utilized to\ndetect cAMP stimulation in TSHR cells.\nThe cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 % FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml\nPenicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 250 ug/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 1 ug/ml\nPuromycin (Invitrogen) at 37C in 5% CO2.  HEK 293 cells expressing CNG but without TSHR (parental\ncells) were used in concert to control for compounds signaling through endogenous receptors and\ntargets of HEK 293 cells.\n\nHigh Throughput Screening. Freshly passaged cells (TSHR or parental) were dispensed into 1536-well\nassay plates at 4 ul/well in DMEM containing phenol red (Invitrogen), 10% FCS (Hyclone), and 100\nunits/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 20\nto 36 hrs before the robotic screening. The screen was initiated by addition of 4 ul/well membrane\npotential dye containing 100 uM RO 20-1724 (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 60 min incubation at room\ntemperature to allow for dye equilibration across the cell membrane. 23 nl/well compound or control\nwas then added to the assay plates, which were incubated for additional 30 min before reading a\nEnvision fluorescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in bottom-read mode for fluorescence intensity\n(emission at 590 nm). \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS screen for compounds effecting the binding of fluorscent GTP to various Ras-related\nGTPases yielded a number of interesting compounds. In this assay a number of compounds and their\neffect on different target proteins were assessed in a dose response manner under different\nconditions than the primary screen. For this assay, the binding buffer has 1 milliM MgCl2 buffer\n(the primary screen were carried out in 1 milliM EDTA buffer).  \nIndividual protein targets (4 microM) are bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C.\nBinding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for\n2 min with 1 milliM MgCl2 and either DMSO or test compound (6 point 10-fold dilution series 100\nmicroM to 0.02 microM) and subsequently adding 50 microL of a fixed concentration (1.5 nanoM) ice\ncold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow\ncytometer. The flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20\nnanometer (FL1)are analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead\npopulation. \n \nCalculations:\nThe binding measurements for each protein target were normalized to the amount of binding in DMSO\nalone:\n%Response = 100*(MCF/MCFwDMSO)\nwhere MCF is the binding of fluorescent GTP at different concentrations of test compound and\nMCFwDMSO is the binding of fluorescent GTP in the presense of DMSO alone. \nThe different %Response values were fit to 4-parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable\nslope:\n%Response= Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/(1 +10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope))\nwhere Bottom and Top are estimates of minimum and maximum of %Response over the concentration range\nof test compounds, LogEC50 is the log of the Effective Concentration of test compound yielding 50%\nchange in the %Response, and HillSlope is variable slope of the dose response curve.\nTarget_SCORE is based on the comparison of the estimated EC50 to the least amount of acceptable\nEC50, 20 microM, for compounds that had a magnitude of change greater than 15%. Thus Target_SCORE =\n100*(1 - (EC50inMicroM/20) where EC50inMicroM is the calculated estimate of EC50 in microM. Active\ncompounds have Target_SCORE greater than 0.  The desired outcome was to find compounds with\nspecific Cdc42 activity, however many compounds also affected other protein targets, namely Rac1.\nThus the overall PUBCHEM_SCORE was left at 0 and compounds were designated 'inconclusive' due to\nthis mixture of activity.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene\nunder control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1\nactivation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism\nwas measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation\nof adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of\nthe CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators\nwould increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely\nproportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1\nagonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate.\n\nThe primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10\nmicromolar final concentration. \n\nThe assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in\ntriplicate. As with the primary run, SEW-2871 was used as the positive control. All data reported\nwas normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar\nSEW-2871 (i.e. 100% agonist) Vs wells that contained forskolin only (0% agonist). \nDose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal\nconcentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The\nreported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50%\nactivity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (95 micromolar) did\nnot result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually\ndepending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values\nof greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10\nmicromolar are considered active.\n\nIn addition to determining the Ec50 values for the #potentiator assay#, Ec50 values were also\ndetermined for the S1P1 assay in #Agonist# mode as well as counterscreened for EC50 values in the\nparental CHO Cre Bla cell line. These three assay results are submitted as individual publications.\nFor the S1P1 agonist assay execution, all parameters are identical to the #potentiator# assay\nexcept test wells only include forskolin devoid of the Ec20 concentration of SEW 2871. For the\nparental CHO Cre Bla cell counterscreen assay all parameters were again identical to the\n#potentiator assay except this cell line doesn#t express S1P1 and was tested in the presence of 4uM\nforskolin only. Ec50#s for these two assays were plotted using the same parameters as above. For\nthe agonist assay, data was normalized to the 1micromolar SEW-2871 Vs forskolin only and for the\nparental cell counterscreen, data was normalized to untreated cells Vs forskolin treated cells.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n\nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next\nday, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and\nSEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar\n(forskolin#s EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871#s EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871\nwas also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e.\nits EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1\nmicroliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer part#K1085),\nprepared according to the manufacturer#s protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma\npart#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm\nand emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting\n#background# (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm\nfluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of\nthe positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive\ncontrol.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis of\nN-linked oligosaccharide chains. CDG group I (CDG-I) defects are defined as those caused by\nmutations in genes encoding enzymes used for the synthesis and transfer of lipid linked\noligosaccharide (LLO) to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER. The steps in this\npathway and the genes encoding them are very similar from yeast to human. It requires 30-40 single\ngene products, each dependent on the previous step in the linear sequence to produce and transfer\nthe LLO to protein. Therefore, mutations in any step may cause a type of CDG. There is considerable\noverlap in the clinical presentations between different types of CDG and a broad diversity within\neach type. The most common form of CDG, called Type Ia (CDG-Ia), is caused by defects in PMM2\n(Man-6-P to Man-1-P), the gene that encodes phosphomannomutase. Mortality is 20% in the first 5\nyrs, but then patients stabilize. Currently, there is no treatment for the CDG-Ia. \nCDG-Ib patients, who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzing conversion of\nMan-6-P to Fru-6-P, are successfully treated with free mannose. Unfortunately, mannose therapy is\nnot effective for CDG-Ia patients, most likely due to efficient Man-6-P consumption in the PMI\nreaction.  It is believed that patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia)\nwill benefit from dietary mannose if there is a simultaneous reduction of phosphomannose isomerase\n(PMI) activity. This would allow a modest intracellular accumulation of Man-6-P and drive metabolic\nflux into the glycosylation pathway using the residual PMM2 activity. It is assumed that a\nnon-competitive inhibitor would work best in this setting; however, identification of chemical\nprobes with diverse modes of action (MOA) would be advantageous for further characterization of PMI\nand PMM variants.  \nThe purpose of this assay is to identify inhibitors of human PMI.  This is accomplished by using a\nG6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through conversion of its\nproduct, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)\nand subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitant with\nNADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The NADPH is then\ndetected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. \nThis assay is performed in the presence of near-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate,\nmannose-6-phosphate, to ensure the identification of inhibitors with diverse MOAs. \nPMI assay materials:\n1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute,\nSan Diego, CA). \n2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.4 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml\nDiaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin.\n3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6\nug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. \nPMI HTS protocol:\n1) 2 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-48 of a Costar 1536-well black plate\n(cat #3724) using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser\n2) 2 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive\ncontrol) of a Costar 1536-well black plate (cat #3724) using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser \n3) 40 nL of 100% DMSO was added to columns 1-4 using a HighRes biosolutions pintool and V&P\nScientific pins\n3) 40 nL of 2 mM compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed in columns 5-48 using a HighRes biosolutions\npintool and V&P Scientific pins\n4) 2 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi\ndispenser. \n5) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. \n6) After 20 minutes the plates were read on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer), Ex544, Em590.\n7) The screening was performed using a HighRes biosolution fully integrated HTS POD-based system\n8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).\nPMI Dose-response confirmation protocol:\n1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate\n(cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix)\n2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive\ncontrol) \n3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial\ndilution.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on\ncellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological\ndisorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the\nprotein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with\nmisfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone\nDnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that\ninhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their\nimportance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel\nantibiotics. \nDnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1-392), a 13kDa\nsubstrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638).\nIt has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of\nchaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good\ntarget for the small organic molecules.\nIn an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the\nsubstrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay the most promising hit and its analogs\nwere tested to determine their Minimal Inhibitory Concentration(MIC) for E. coli growth.\nMaterials:\n1)  Testing was done in Mueller-Hinton II broth (BBL). \nProtocols:\n1) All compounds were first tested for their ability to limit cell growth of E. coli.\n2) Compounds showing binding by NMR were tested over a range of concentrations.\n3) E. coli growth in the presence of compounds were determined by mixing 90 uL of an OD600 = 0.001\nwith 10 uL of various concentrations of compound and grown overnight in a 96-well plate.\n4) Optical density at 530 nm was measured using a Perkin Elmer Victor 2 Multilabel plate reader. \nSince DnaK is required for growth under heat shock conditions, we tested the compounds ability to\nkill E. coli at 42 oC.\n5) The MIC was read as the concentration producing a greater than 2-fold reduction in growth\n" ;

The fusion\nprotein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands\nthat promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities,\nallowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an\nagonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride,\n100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns\nwere filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3\nmicrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2\nprotein [aa 624-829]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM\nfinal nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells.\nImmediately after addition of test compounds fluorescence (t0) was measured by exciting at 340 nm,\nand reading fluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate\nreader (Perkin Elmer). The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and\nfluorescence was measured again (t15). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored\nat 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated for each timepoint, according to the following\nmathematical expressions:\nt15_Ratio = t15_I671nm / t15_I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl))\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nData were evaluated using % Activation. Any compound that exhibited an average % Activation greater\nthan the hit cutoff calculated for the Primary screen was declared active.

Stimulation of 5HT1E by agonist induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha15 protein\ncoupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a BLA\nFRET substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a 5HT1E antagonist will decrease well FRET.\nCompounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal\nconcentration of 50 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO cell line was cultured in T-175 flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media containing 10% v/v heat inactivated\ndialyzed fetal bovine serum , 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 1\nmg/mL Geneticin, 5 micrograms /mL Blasticidin, 100 micrograms/ml Zeocin, and 1x\npenicillin-streptomycin-neomycin mix.

Then, 50 nL of either test compound or DMSO control was added to the\nappropriate wells, in the presence of 1.1 ul of the selective 5HT1E agonist, BRL-54443 (3 nM final\nnominal EC90 concentration). Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours.\nAfter the incubation 2 ul/well of the GeneBlazer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according\nto the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added.

Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" (ie,\nfluorescence values from wells containing media and substrate only). \nTo normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well,\naccording to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I590 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100*(1-((Ratio_Test_Compound # Median_Ratio_High_Control) /\n(Median_Ratio_Low_Control # Median_Ratio_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and BRL-54443,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing BRL-54443,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.7 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.7\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an\nIC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nActive compounds of this assay fall into the activity score range of 53 to 100 and inactive\ncompounds have range of activity score from 0 to 50.\nList of Reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081)\nHygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part 15140-055)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029)\nDialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part SH30079.03)\nBRL-54443 (Sigma, part B-173)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\n384-well Plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a\nloss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in\nmodulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\n\nCell culture, plating, and dye loading. HEK/GIRK cells stably expressing the M4 muscarinic receptor\nwere grown in 45 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45 percent Ham's F12, 10 percent\nfetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium\npyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 700 ug/ml G418. The rat mGluR4 cell line was prepared by PCR\namplification of the entire coding sequence of each receptor and cloning into pIRES puro 3\n(Invitrogen). Cloning sites were BamHI/Not I. HEK/GIRK/M4 cells were transfected with 24 ug of DNA\nand stable transfectants were selected with puromycin. And a monoclonal cell lines was established.\nCells were grown in 45 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 45 percent Ham's F12,\n10percent fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1\nmM sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine (Growth Media). mGluR/GIRK lines were supplemented with 600\nng/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and 700 ug/ml G418 (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA).\nCells for experiments were generally maintained for approximately 15-20 passages; this was\nparticularly important for experiments examining the endogenous alpha2C receptor.\nAssays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Cells were\nplated into 384 well, black-walled, clear-bottom poly-D-lysine coated plates (Greiner) at a density\nof 15,000 cells/20 uL/well in DMEM containing 10 percent dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 100\nunits/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Assay Media). Plated cells were incubated overnight at 37 degrees\nC in the presence of 5 percent CO2. The following day, the medium was removed from the cells and 20\nuL/well of 1.7 uM concentration of the indicator dye BTC-AM (Invitrogen; prepared as a stock in\nDMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with pluronic acid F-127) in Assay Buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt\nSolution (Invitrogen) containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3) was added to the plated cells. Cells were\nincubated for one hour at room temperature and the dye was replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer.\nTest compound preparation. Glutamate was diluted in Thallium Buffer (125 mM sodium bicarbonate\n(added fresh the morning of the experiment), 1 mM magnesium sulfate, 1.8 mM calcium sulfate, 5 mM\nglucose, 12 mM thallium sulfate, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) at 5x the final concentration to be assayed.\nFor fold shift experiments, compounds were diluted to a 60 uM (2x final) concentration in Assay\nBuffer. Cell plates and compound plates were loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging\nplate reader. Appropriate baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 470+/-20 nm\nemission, 540+/-30 nm) and test compounds were added. Compounds were added in a 20 uL volume and\nincubated for approximately 2.5 minutes prior to the addition of 10 ul of Thallium Buffer +/-\nagonist. After the addition of agonist, data were collected for an additional 2 min. \nThallium sulfate requires special handling and disposal precautions and investigators are cautioned\nto contact their Environmental Health and Safety Department to ensure proper procedures are\nfollowed.\nData analysis. Data were analyzed using usoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data\npoint in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For\nexperiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing\neach point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any\nsubtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the\nfluorescence increase beginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen\nseconds after thallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point\nlogistical equation using XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of\nconcentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source\ncompounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point\nlogistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).\nFor compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate 3 fold or less, 'Outcome' was assigned as\n'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '1'. For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate\ngreater than 3 fold, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. 'Score' was assigned as '50' for those\nwith a fold-shift less than or equal to 10 or as '100' for those with a fold-shift greater than 10.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based cell-based high-throughput dose response assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y2.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of\nfeeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional\nregulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and\nalcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor,\na 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production.\nNPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus\nsolitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile\nand biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is\npredicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission,\nY2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this\nhypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type\ncontrols (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress\nethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure\nand high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6).\nTherefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y2 potentiation dose response curves for compounds\nidentified as active in a set of experiments entitled, #Primary cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2 (AID 1359), #Confirmation cell-based\nhigh-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2# (AID 1539),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n#Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1 (AID\n1304), and #Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity# (PubChem AID 1703).\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y2 receptor.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as a potentiator or agonist of NPY-2 will\nincrease Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe\nfluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using\na 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2\nHEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each\nwell of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates\nwere incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing\n2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated\nat room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was\nperformed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices),\nthen the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA.\nNext, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the\nappropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by\nchallenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings. \nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n# MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-84, for inactives 63-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y2 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344870)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions \n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nEach component of the multiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a\nbiotinylated RGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and\na fluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Test\ncompound concentration is 10 microM. Controls, which contain the same bead mixture and\nAF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 of each plate (Positive\nControl Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90 minutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using IDLeQuery/HyperView software (software developed inhouse by Dr.\nBruce Edwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by\nHyperSip software. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each\nwell. The parsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed\nspecifically for the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence\nscavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters\nis used to identify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel\nfluorescence (MCF) from FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled\nGalphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of compound, if the\nmeasured MCF from scavenger bead is greater than or equal to 40% of that from the positive control\nbead set, the compound is considered a potential fluorescent compound.\nSample fluorescence for all the different proteins in a well are corrected for background\nfluorescence, based on potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate\ntrends), normalization is also utilized to calculate the percent regulation of the test compound.\nThe background subtracted and normalized sample fluorescence is referred to as the Response Value\nof the test compound (RV, see column titled RESPONSE_VALUE). Due to the nature of this assay,\ninstead of using a universal positive control for the whole plate, individual row trends of the\ncontrols are evaluated by linear regression. Then based on the plate location of a sample, a\ncalculated Positive Control value (Notated with LinFit) is utilized for calculating the normalized\nresponse value. RV of the compound is calculated by the following equation:\nRV = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(LinFitPCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of MCF in FL1 (530 nanom) associated with the protein-coupled bead\nset. SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, LinFitPCntrl is the calculated value\nbased on row dependent linear regression of wells without test compounds, and NCntrl is from the\nmeasurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of RV is\n100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A compound with\nactivating effects would have RV greater than 100 and a compound with inhibitory effects would have\nRV less than 100.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE corresponds directly with the percent of regulation of the compound;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is the absolute value of RV minus 100,|%Reg|. The maximum\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100 for primary screening is given when |%Reg| is greater then 100,\nmeaning 100% activation or inhibition effect; the minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0 means the\nsubstance has no impact on the target RGS-Galphao interaction. \nAn active compound for RGS8 have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 25 and the type of active\ncompound (Activator or Inhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

The growth\nmedia consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat\ninactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine\nand 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0\nmillion/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent\ncharcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Prior to assay 10 ul (100, 000 cells/well) of cell\nsuspension was dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37\ndegrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the\nMLSCN library or DMSO control to sample or control wells, respectively.  Next, 1.1 ul of S1P in 2\npercent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 1\nuM).  Then, 1.1 ul of 2 percent fatty acid free BSA was dispensed to negative control and test\ncompound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the\nincubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at\nroom temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm\nand 460 nm.  \nPercent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression:\nPercent Activation = 100 *(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) /\n(median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)\nWhere:\nTest compound well is defined as wells containing compound from the MLSCN library compound library\nWell  ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured\nfluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength.\nNegative control is defined as well containing 2 percent fatty acid free BSA\nPositive control is defined as well containing 1 uM S1P\nEach compound was assayed in triplicate using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 42 uM.  For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound\nconcentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response\ncurve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of\nY-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (42.8 uM) did not result in > 50 percent activation\nor where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed\nactivation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were\nconsidered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50percent activation\nis observed.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule antagonists of the human angiotensin II\nreceptor type 1 (AT1). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity\nof hits originally identified in an uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for antagonists of the APJ\nreceptor. This AT1 antagonist assay utilizes the same luminescent b-Arrestin-based assay readout as\nthe uHTS APJ primary assay. In both assays we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly\nmeasure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin\nassay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the KOR1\nreceptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the\nenzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly\ncomplementing fragment termed ProLin. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand\nstimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the\ncomplementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme\nthat converts substrate to detectable signal.\nThis assay is a follow-up to \"uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the APJ \nreceptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 2521.\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "TR-FRET dose response biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid\nreceptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\n(PPAR gamma): non-selective agonists.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for\nagonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome\nproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)\" (PubChem AID 1048) and that confirmed activity\nin a set of experiments entitled, \"Confirmation biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for\nagonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome\nproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)\" (AID 1301).\nThis assay tests the ability of compounds to increase the interactions between PPARg and its\ncoactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a\nGST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-3 coactivator. The\nfusion protein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that\npromote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities,\nallowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as\nan agonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution\nseries starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM\nSodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns\nwere filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3\nmicrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged\nSRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO\n(0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15\nhours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured. After excitation at 340 nm, well\nfluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader\n(Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical\nexpression:\nRatio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl))\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 66 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 71 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part 71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762] (produced by Dr. Scott Busby, Scripps Florida).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and\nreversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel\nresearch tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal.\nThe purpose of this assay confirm hits from \"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the\nAPJ receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 2520.\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "A biochemical assay using the ADP-Hunter methodology, purified TAg, and ATP to identify compounds\nthat inhibit the ATPase activity of Tag.\n\nAssay Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized\nmodel system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also\nclosely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and\nmortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes\ndisease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue.\nUnlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of\nthe population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio\nvaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are\nunclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these\nPolyomaviruses.\nThe oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor\nantigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that\nTAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that\nmutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular\ntransformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate\nthe unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous\nATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions\nhas been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of\nTAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in\ninfected cells.\nChemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the\ncatastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully\ndeveloped a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus\ninhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays\nfor target validation will allow a prioritization of \"hits\" from the primary screen. A biochemical\nfluorescence-intensity assay in 1536-well microplate format was developed to measure TAg ATPase\nactivity in the presence of potentially inhibitory compounds. Z values are ~0.68, with > 3-fold S/B\nand a high (5%) DMSO tolerance. \nPrimary Assay Conditions: The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates.\nAssay buffer was 100mM Tris-HCl, 20mM KCl, 6mM MgCl2, and 0.1mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4. Initially, 250nl of\ntest compound (20uM final concentration) in 4% DMSO/assay buffer was added to the respective plate\nwells. Total reaction volume (without endpoint reagent) was 1.25ul. Total read volume (with\nendpoint reagent) was 5 ul. Enzyme and buffer volumeswere dispensed using a BioRAPTR FRD (Beckman\nCoulter, Fullerton, CA). Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 500 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte,\nSunnyvale, CA). Purified TAg was diluted to a concentration of 0.0144 ug/ul in assay buffer. 750nl\nof TAg (14.4ng/ul, 10.8ng total) in assay buffer was added to each well and allowed to incubate for\n30m at ambient temperature. Following incubation, 250nl of 5mM ATP (A7699, Sigma-Aldrich, St.\nLouis, MO) in assay buffer was added to the respective wells, and incubated for 120m at ambient\ntemperature. Final DMSO concentration was 1.0%. \nEndpoint addition and read: After incubation, the ADPHunter-Plus Kit (DiscoverX, Freemont, CA) was\nused to determine the extent of TAg-induced ATP hydrolysis. 1.25ul of Reagent A, immediately\nfollowed by 2.5ul of Reagent B, was added to the wells, and allowed to incubate for a further 10m\nat ambient temperature. Addition of the kit stop solution had no effect on the assay and\nsubsequently was not used. The plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision\nplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 530/590nm respectively.\nControls and Drug Addition: Controls included full reaction wells (TAg, DMSO blank, and ATP),\nbackground wells (Assay buffer, DMSO blank, and ATP), and control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO\nand ATP), per plate. Positive control drug (Mal112B) was diluted in 4% DMSO/assay media and added\nto each plate (250nl at 5x concentration), for a final concentration of 100uM. 2.5nl of compounds\nin 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler\n(Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 20uM. DMSO concentration from the compounds\namounted to 0.2%, bringing the total per well to 1%. DMSO in control wells was also supplemented,\nto maintain a concentration of 1% for all wells of each plate.\nLarge T Antigen purification: TAg was purified essentially as described by Cantalupo, P., et.\nal.,1999. Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with a TAg-encoding baculovirus. At 45 hpi, cells were\nharvested and lysed in LiCl and NP40-containing lysis buffer. The lysate was spun at 27000g and the\nhigh speed supernatant was loaded to a Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences)\ncolumn to which the resin had been covalently crosslinked to the monoclonal antibody PAb419. \nPAb419 has been previously described to recognize an N-terminal epitope\nof TAg. The column was washed, and then eluted at high pH. TAg containing fractions were dialyzed\ninto 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1mM DTT, and flash frozen in\nliquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. \nData Analysis: 96 full reaction wells, 96 background wells, and 64 control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B\nin DMSO and ATP), per plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data\non a per plate basis. The overall Z score for the primary assay was 0.6. \nResults were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and calculated as: 100*((Median Enzyme\nControl-High Dose Ctrl Drug) - (Test well-High Dose Ctrl Drug))/(Median Enzyme Ctrl-High Dose Ctrl\nDrug). Dose response results for each concentration were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base\nsoftware. Compounds showing at least 50% inhibition were considered active and IC50 values were\ncalculated using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum\nand minimum locked at 100 and 0.\n" ;

The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary\ngland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin\nsignaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through\nregulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis.\nSignificantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung\nfibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human\nrelaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive\nheart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic\nsclerosis.\nUpon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs.\ncAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP\nincrease is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists\nof the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1\nactivation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence\nenergy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit.\nThis assay measures activation of a cell expressing V1B, another GPCR targeted by relaxin, to\ndetermine the selectivity of compounds for RXFP1.\n\nThis is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP2\nreceptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were\nlysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell\nlysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to\na decrease in the TR-FRET signal.

The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate\nadenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)\nconcentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell\nmembrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that\nacts as an agonist of Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG\nchannel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were\ntested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into\neach well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added\nto the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control -\nMedianRatio_Low_Control)*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were\ncalculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells\ncontaining only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these\ntwo values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation\nthan the cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation\nvalue. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 15 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 15 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The E3 ligases are involved in regulating other proteins by covalent ligation to the 76 amino acid\nprotein ubiquitin. This post-translational modification can result in altered conformation, altered\nactivity, or degradation of the substrate protein. Thus, E3 ligases are effectors of a major means\nof post-translational modification of proteins in many species, including mammals. The dipeptide\nboronic acid bortezomib is a potent proteasome inhibitor, has selective anticancer activity in\ntumor cells and in mice and was recently approved for clinical use in multiple myeloma. MDM2 E3\nligase is involved in numerous types of human cancer. Selective E3 ligase inhibitors would be\npreferable as they would be more selective and less toxic.\nInhibitors of the MDM2-UBCH5 interaction should disrupt the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 and\ntherefore its oncogenic activity. Such inhibitors could be developed into novel therapeutic agents\nfor sarcomas involving MDM2 overexpression or amplification, irrespective of their p53 status.\nPatients with sarcomas are likely to\nbenefit from this approach because of their high frequency of MDM2 protein overexpression and MDM2\ngene amplification.\nCellular autoubiquitination assay: an MDM2-GFP fusion protein\nautoubiquitinates and autodegrades in vivo. This approach was adapted to luciferase, because\nluciferase is easier to detect in high-throughput assays. A cellular assay for autoubiquitination\nin 384-well format was designed. An MDM2 E3-luciferase fusion protein was stably transfected into\nmammalian cells. The fusion protein autoubiquitinates, targeting itself for degradation.\nLuminescence is used to monitor protein abundance. A negative control of inactive RING domains\nfused to\nluciferase, known to have no ubiquitination activity, has been developed as a counterscreen. \nWe have used a cell-based MDM2 autoubiquitination screen to identify small molecules that inhibit\nMDM2 E3 ligase activity. The cell based assay uses full-length MDM2 fused to luciferase. This\nconstruct autoubiquitinates itself and autodegrades. The screen will identify compounds that\nprevent this autodegradation and stabilize the MDM2-luciferase construct by blocking MDM2 E3 ligase\nactivity. Thus inhibitors will show an enhanced luminescence signal. \nWe have earlier screened 218,724 compounds of the MLSCN library (AID 1230) and identified 220\nactives. Of the 200 compounds tested, 40 showed a good dose-response and were reported as hits\nagainst E3 ligase (AID 1394). These 40 compounds were retested for dose-response in triplicate,\nwhich is reported here.\n\nCells (wild-type or mutant) were plated and allowed to settle at 37C overnight. The cells were then\nincubated with different concentrations of compound (final DMSO conc:0.25%) at 37C for 2 hrs.\nSteadyLite luciferase reagent was added, plates incubated for 30 mins and then read on Envision\nreader.\nDose-response protocol\n1.Fill 384 well plate with 24 uL of cells (wild-type or mutant) in DMEM (7500 cells per well) using\nWellmate (all columns except 1 and 23)\n2.Add 24 uL DMEM to columns 1 and 23 using Wellmate\n3. Seal plates with Breathe-easy membranes and incubate at 37C overnight\n4.Dilute 1 ul of compound from dose-response plate with 79 ul DMEM to get a diluted dose-response\nplate (top concentration 125 uM)\n5. Add 6 ul of diluted compound to the overnight-grown cells, seal with Breathe-easy membrane and\nincubate at 37C for 2 hrs\n6.Add 30 ul SteadyLite HTS reagent and incubate at room temperature for 30 min\n7.Read luminescence on Envision reader\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), previously known as GPR154, is a recently de-orphanized G protein\ncoupled receptor. Its endogenous ligand is the 20 amino acids peptide Neuropeptide S (NPS).\nActivation of NPSR induces transient increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP, suggesting\ncoupling of this receptor to both Gs and Gq G proteins. NPS and its receptor are found in various\ntissues.  Specifically they are highly expressed in brain areas that have been implicated in\nmodulation of arousal, stress and anxiety. Central administration of NPS in mice produces an\nunusual profile of activity by inducing wakefulness and arousal, while at the same time suppressing\nanxiety. Therefore, NPSR may represent a novel drug target for the treatment of sleep and anxiety\ndisorders. \nAs one method of confirming the specific activity of compounds active in the primary screen (AID\n1461), we developed an assay to measure the displacement of radio-labeled native ligand, NPS, from\nits receptor in vitro.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted\npyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to\nbe crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas\nSpecialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications\nincluded functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the\n3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to\nthe fully unsaturated pyrazole.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kd#s are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Lithium has been widely used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. But lithium has a narrow\ntherapeutic index and it can cause side effects such as thirst, weight gain, tremor, polyuria and\nmemory problems. Although the mechanism for lithium action in treatment of bipolar disorder is\nstill not fully understood, inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and the subsequent\ndepletion of the inositol pool in living cells have been implicated as the primary therapeutic\nbenefit of lithium therapy. Therefore, a selective IMPase inhibitor with reduced side effects might\nbe a good drug candidate to replace lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Several IMPase\ninhibitors have been discovered previously. However, they are not suitable for therapeutic use\nbecause of their poor cell membrane penetrability or oral bioavailability; the development of new\ncell-permeable IMPase inhibitors is needed. \nIMPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) to release free inositol. Binding of\nan agonist to a Gq coupled GPCR results in the activation of PLC, which hydrolyzes the PIP2 to form\ninositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). While DAG activates protein kinase C\n(PKC), IP3 triggers the elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. The IP3 is very rapidly inactivated\nby hydrolysis to IP2, IP1 and then inositol by a series of enzymes including IMPase. Free inositols\nare used for synthesis of PI and thus start another inositol cycle. \nTo identify new cell-permeable IMPase inhibitors, we developed a cell-based IMPase assay in which\nthe cytosolic IP1 is measured by a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)\nassay. In this assay, an IP1 specific antibody is used to detect the labeled IP1 tracer. When the\ncell lysate contains the elevated IP1 due to the inhibition of IMPase, the TR-FRET between the\nlabeled antibody and IP1 tracer is disrupted resulting in a reduction in the total signal. Since\nthe TR-FRET is used, this cell-based assay is a homogenous assay without cell wash and medium\nchange that is suitable for assay miniaturization and HTS. In this particular assay, a small amount\nof lithium is added to potentiate the response of weak activators.\n\nA Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the M1 receptor (CHO-M1) was obtained\nfrom ATCC and maintained in F-12 Kaighn's media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10 %\nFBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250 ug/ml geneticin at 37C, 5% CO2 in a\nhumidified atmosphere. Before the assay, aliquots of cells were frozen and stored at -135C. The\nassay was performed in 1536-well format. Data are reported for both the ratio of the two emission\nwavelengths, and also for the component 'donor' channel, Em2=620. Data were normalized to the\ncontrols for basal activity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (18.4 mM LiCl). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n(1) Frozen CHO-M1 cells were thaw, washed once with fresh media and resuspended in F12K media\ncontaining 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at\n4ul/well (2000 cells) in white, tissue culture treated 1536-well plates, and then cultured at 37C,\n5 % CO2 for 16 to 30 hours.\n(2) Add 23 nl/well of compound in DMSO solution. The final titration for each compound was between\n0.6 nM and 46 uM.\n(3) Add 1 ul of stimulation reagent (250 uM carbachol and 500 uM LiCl in stimulation buffer\ncontaining10mM HEPES, 1mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 4.2 mM KCl, 146 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 50mM LiCl,\npH 7.4)\n(4) Incubation at 37C, 5 % CO2 for 30 min.\n(5) Add 1 ul/well of d2-conjugated IP1 (d2-IP1) and 1 ul/well of Eu+ cryptate conjugated anti-IP1\nantibody (Eu+-Ab) prepared in the cell lysis buffer, both from the IP-One kit (Cisbio, MA).\n(6) Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.\n(7) Detect the assay plate (Ex = 320, Em1 =665 and Em2 620) in a ViewLux plate reader.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A\ncell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was\nused to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an\nallosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor\nsubtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of\nmuscarinic receptor function in the CNS.\nAgents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\n(mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving\ncognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with\nthese agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients\nwith AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist,\nxanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that\nmAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from\nschizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders.\nEvidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1\nmAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have\nfailed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects\nassociated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective\ncompounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical\neffects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable\ncandidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects.\nPrevious attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other\nspecific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and\ndifficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major\nadvances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding\nsite [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be\nhighly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective\nagonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor\nrather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and\nprovide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4].\nThe purpose of this screen was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M3 receptor for\ntheir ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding.\nExperimental Protocol:\nMembranes were prepared from M3-expressing CHO cells as described. Binding\nreactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 ug of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final,\nto define total binding) or 1uM atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500\nul. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in\nDMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final\nDMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at\nroom temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped\nand membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a\nBrandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4).\nFilter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter\n(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an\nacetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations\n(3 to 30uM, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after\ncounting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to\napproximately 5% or less.\nShirey JK, Xiang Z, Orton D, Brady AE, Johnson KA, Williams R, Ayala JE,Rodriguez AL, Wess J,\nWeaver D, Niswender CM, Conn PJ., \"An allosteric potentiator of M4 mAChR modulates hippocampal\nsynaptic transmission.\" Nat Chem Biol. 2008 Jan;4(1):42-50. PMID: 18059262\nData Fitting:\nData from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum\nspecific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and\nfitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no\nweighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30\nmicromolar did not fit a full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive\nstatistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and\nthe 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate\nReceptor 4 (S1P4).\n\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonism activity of compounds identified as active\nin a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1510). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS\ncells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the\nGPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4\nmigrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic,\ncell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit\nS1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and\nBLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a\nfinal nominal concentration of 5 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4\nmicroliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was\nadded to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next,\nS1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.3 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate\nwells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1\nul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol\nand containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room\ntemperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences,\nTurku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535\nnm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nInhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nAny compound that exhibited a percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the\nPrimary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100%\nof the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity\nscore zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 23 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 23 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy#s 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

The transfected cells were incubated with two different\nconcentrations of estradiol (E2) and increasing concentrations of CBI; luciferase activity was then\nmeasured.  If the compound acts by a coactivator binding inhibition mechanism - that is, by\ndirectly competing with the SRCs -\n then a change in the concentration of E2 should have no effect on the IC50 of the compound.  We\nsee no change in compound IC50 in the presence of either 1 nM or 100 nM E2, indicating that the\ninhibition of transcription is, in fact, occurring by a coactivator binding inhibition mechanism. \nAn internal beta-galactosidase control suggests that the cells are viable at all concentrations of\nthe CBIs, verifying that the effect of the CBIs is not due to general cell toxicity.\nCompounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 629 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha\nCoactivator Binding Inhibitors, were selected for testing in this assay. \nHuman endometrial cancer cells (HEC-1) were maintained in culture as described and transfected in\n24 well plates.

For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling.

The caspases\nrepresent an important class of drug targets for stroke, ischemia, cancer and inflammatory\ndiseases. Comparison of crystal structures of procaspases and caspases have revealed that the\nsubunits of the homodimer are composed of subdomains which have highly conserved architecture and\nmechanism, and show large structural transitions between procaspase and active conformers. One goal\nof this project was to identify compounds that act as allosteric inhibitors via stabilizing the\nprocaspase form of the enzyme. Previous work in Well's laboratory has shown that such allosteric\ninhibitors can be identified and these act by binding at the dimer interface of enzyme.\n\nThe biochemical assay was configured using purified caspase 1 at a high enzyme concentration to\npromote formation of the homodimers and thus facilitate the identification of allosteric\ninhibitors. The overall goal was to identify reversible inhibitors with better drug-like properties\nthan the currently available set of aspartyl-containing peptidomimetics that covalently bind the\nactive site. Caspase 1 was assayed using the profluorescent substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC. After initiation\nof the assay with substrate the plates were rapidly read using an automated robotic system\n(Kalypsys, Inc.) to maintain consistent timing.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded\nbreaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer,\ngenetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible\nfor repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor\nsuppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in\nanti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is\nessential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer\ntherapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search\nfor homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step\nof HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and\nstimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions.\nOur goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as\nchemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer\ntherapies.\nDNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51\nprotein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this\nassay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides\n(47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm\nand the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1\n(BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with\nthe sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary\noligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the\nphoton emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an\nincrease in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the\nduplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA\nstrand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein\nfilament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the\nfluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this\nfluorescence. \nMaterials\nHuman Rad 51 protein, labeled ss & ds DNA were provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence\nassay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). All buffer\nsalts were from Sigma. \nAssay\nhRad 51 protein was incubated with ss DNA to allow filament formation (37 deg C for 15 min).\nCompounds (10 uM final concentration) were pre-incubated with the protein for 30 min. followed by\naddition of ds DNA to initiate strand exchange. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room\ntemperature for 15 min and then plates were read on Envision plate reader. \nHTS protocol\n1.Fill 384 well plate with 4 uL of water (nuclease-free) using Multidrop \n2.Pin Tool compound into the plates using 384 pin-tool\n3.

Percent inhibition was calculated for each compound from the signal in\nfluorescence units (FU) and the mean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using\nthe following equation:\n% Inhibition = 100*(1-((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean)))\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence dose response cell-based high throughput screening assay for antagonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a\nprevious set of experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1510) and that confirmed activity in a set\nof experiments entitled, \"Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for antagonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (AID 1524). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells\nwhich contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the\nGPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4\nmigrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is\nmonitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic,\ncell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit\nS1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and\nBLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a\n10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 %\nfinal concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.3 uM final nominal\nEC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C\nin 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture,\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all\nwells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405\nnm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nInhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. Compounds\nwith an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less\nthan 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nAll compounds in this assay are active and range of activity score is 0 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases.\n\nRas and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the\nUniversity of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral\nphenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the\npiperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring\nother heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with\npiperidine.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

This assay\nmeasures the ability of small molecules with unknown GPR30 binding affinity to compete with an\nAlexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to GPR30 in permeabilized whole cells\nexpressing GPR30-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist\ncharacteristics of molecules that bind GPR30 will be assessed using various secondary assays.\nThe assay is conducted in 96-well PCR plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells\n(ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with GRP30-GFP using\nLipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer#s instructrions). Twenty-four hours following\ntransfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine\nto serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine and cells\nare grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at\n1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. \nThe assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control; column 12 contains\npositive control (1 microM estrogen). Columns 2-11 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to\nassay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1%\nBSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of\ncompound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of\npermeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES\n[Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633\nand 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at\nroom temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and\nresuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high\nthroughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter\nand GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is\ncollected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). \nPrimary screening was completed at 10 microM.\n\nAcquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery\nidentifies 96- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population\nis identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for\nanalysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the\nbasis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and\ndefined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen)\nwells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding.\nSample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control\nwells.\nCompounds were considered \"Active\" if they inhibited more than 60% of binding at 10 microM.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for \"Actives\" and 1 for \"Non-Actives.\"\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding\ncompared with activity cutoff (i.e., 60%). Compounds with percent inhibition below activity cutoff\n(i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to\ncalculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for Active compounds with percent inhibition above activity\ncutoff:\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff)\nwhere Cutoff was 60% and %Inhibition was the %inhibition above the Cutoff.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dose Response cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of galanin\nreceptor 2 (GALR2).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds from the MLSCN\nlibrary that were active in a previous screen entitled, \"Confirmatory cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay to identify antagonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2),\" (PubChem AID 866). \nCompounds were assessed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 42 uM.  In this assay GALR2 antagonism was measured using a cell line stably\nexpressing human GALR2 and beta-lactamase (BLA) genes under control of the Nuclear Factor of\nActivated T-cells (NFAT) promoter.  Stimulation of GALR2 and coupling to Gq induces release of\ncytoplasmic Ca2+ and nuclear translocation of NFAT where it activates transcription of the BLA\nreporter gene.  In the presence of antagonist GALR2 exhibits low basal activity and cells express\nlow BLA levels.  Thus, BLA expression is inversely proportional to antagonist concentration. \nChanges in BLA expression are monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nof a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.  As designed, a GALR2 antagonist will\ndecrease FRET.\n \nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human GALR2 and NFAT-BLA were routinely\ncultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media\nconsisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated\nbovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1\nmg/mL Zeocin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.5 million/mL in assay\nmedia (growth media as above but without Zeocin and Geneticin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were\ndispensed per test well of a 1536-well plate (2000 cells/well), followed by incubation at 25\ndegrees C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour.  Following the incubation, the assay was started by dispensing 21\nnL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (negative control wells)\nto the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 ul of 2% BSA (low control wells; in 2% BSA) or galanin (1-16)\npeptide (high control wells; 150 nM final nominal concentration in 2% BSA; EC80) was dispensed to\nthe appropriate control wells.  Next, 1 ul of 2% BSA was dispensed into sample field wells.  The\nplates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours, followed by addition of 1\nmicroliter/well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol). After a further 2 hours of incubation at room\ntemperature, well fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku,\nFinland). \nPrior to normalization, fluorescence values for each channel were corrected by subtracting\n\"background\" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only.\n To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were\nused to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/I535 nm \nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Inhibition = ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))*100 \nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing 2% BSA in PBS \nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing galanin (1-16) in 2% BSA.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 42 uM) did not result\nin greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 42 micromolar. \nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero.

This\nparticular assay uses a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LYMP2-009) purchased from Coriell Institute\nfor Medical Research.\n\nThe CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the\nnumber of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a\nloss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in\nmodulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\nBasic protocol:\n1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media\n(DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate).\n2. The following day, media is removed from the cells.\n3. 20 ul/well of Fluo Zn dye (0.33 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 20mM HEPES) is added.\n4. The plates are incubated for one hour at RT.\n5. Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual\nvolume.\n6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT.\n7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS.\n8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20\nul added per well) and the agonist (LP-4) is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added\nper well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition\n(compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added\nat 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds.\nData analysis:\nData were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a\ngiven trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in\nwhich antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the\nfluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in\nthe baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase\nbeginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after\nthallium/agonist addition was calculated. Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation\nusing Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ).\nThis compound was not a positive allosteric modulator of rat mGluR7 and was assigned an 'Outcome'\nof 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'.\n" ;

This assay employs the\nIP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the\nGq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C\n(PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1\nantibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this\nassay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding\nof the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1\nmolecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1\nproduction by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled\nIP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists\nwill prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to\ncompete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled\nanti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases.\n\nRas and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that\nwere purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single\nparticular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated\nagainst different GTPase targets.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

Compounds were\ntested at 10uM final concentration against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing\ncDNAs for GIRK 1, GIRK 2, and the M4 muscarinic receptor.

Not surprisingly, miRNAs have\nbeen found to be oncogenic or tumor suppressive, with altered miRNA expression levels associated\nwith human cancers. The miRNA miR-21 has been found to be\nexpressed in most human tissues, and its overexpression has been associated\nwith a variety of human tumors. miR-21 has been shown to be\nanti-apoptotic: knock-down of miR-21 in a glioblastoma cell line was found to activate caspases and\nlead to apoptosis.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in \nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original Cdc42 selective inhibitor MLS000693334 a series of 1, 3, 5-substituted\npyrazolines was investigated via SAR by commerce. The sulfonamide of the original hit was found to\nbe crucial for activity and synthesis was planned and executed by the University of Kansas\nSpecialized Chemistry Center around this pyrazolinyl-benzenesulfonamide substructure. Modifications\nincluded functional group substitution of the 1, 3, 5-phenyl substituents, replacement of the\n3-phenyl substituent with alkyl or heteroaryl-groups, and conversion of the central heterocycle to\nthe fully unsaturated pyrazole.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

Although it is controversial whether SV40\nalso causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the\nsurrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture\nsystems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40,\nprobably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects\nof SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases\nassociated with these Polyomaviruses.\n\nThe oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor\nantigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that\nTAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that\nmutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular\ntransformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate\nthe unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous\nATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions\nhas been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of\nTAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in\ninfected cells.\n\nChemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the\ncatastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully\ndeveloped a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus\ninhibitors. This counter screens for hit toxicity in MDCK cells, along with the secondary assays\nfor target validation will allow a prioritization of \"hits\" from the primary screen. \nProtocol:  Cytotoxicity was evaluated using Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL-34). \nThis assay was conducted with 999 of the 1205 compounds designated as active in the confirmation\nand counterscreens.

At the end of the\nincubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that\nwere considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal.  Compounds that interfere\nwith luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.  \n" ;

The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the lymphoblastoid cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 24\nhours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntetraoctylammonium bromide was used as positive control. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (92 uM tetraoctylammonium bromide). AC50 values were\ndetermined from concentration-response data modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the\noriginating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily\n\nThe assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a\nhigh-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1.  The assay was performed in a \"duplex\"\nformat in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL)\ncell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1.  The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a\nred-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells\nduring flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the\npeptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with\nhigh affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were\ndetermined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the\nduplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.  \n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).  fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \n\nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform  was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\nTest compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as\n%Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)]\nin which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells\ncontaining test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of\ncells in negative control wells, respectively.\nTest compounds were hit-picked at a 10 milliM concentration in DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 eight\ntimes for a total of nine different test compound concentrations.  Final concentrations in the\nassay ranged from 10.2 nanoM to 66.7 microM.\n\nIn an individual dose response experiment, each compound was tested in duplicate to result in 18\ndata points. Some compounds were tested in more than one dose-response experiment. The number of\ndata points for dose response curves ranged from 18 (a single experiment) to 90 (5 experiments). In\nsome cases individual data points were determined to be statistical outliers and were eliminated\nfrom the analysis. \n\nFPRL1 expression ranged from 100,000 to 200,000 receptors per cell in different assays as\ndetermined by comparison to standard curves generated with Fluorescein Reference Standard\nMicrobeads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN).  This corresponded to total FPRL1 concentrations of\n0.6 to 1.2 nanoM.  To account for effects of possible ligand depletion at the higher receptor\nconcentrations, inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from IC50 estimates\n\nKi determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in\nthe dose response assay. Test compounds with Ki less than 10 microM were scored as active and all\nothers as inactive. The activity scores of active compounds were calculated as:\nActivity Score = 100 x ( 1 - (Ki / Ki_Max) )\nIn which Ki_Max was 10 microM, the upper Ki threshold for an active test compound.\nFull sets of curve-fit statistics were reported only for test compounds in which the estimated IC50\nwas less than 66.7 microM, the highest test compound concentration evaluated.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalingTheir diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.\n" ;

Deficiency\nof this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe\ndisease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes\nand cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within\nlysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms from\narchaebacteria to humans, suggesting an essential role in cell survival (1, 2). Under circumstances\nof transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can\nrestore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when\npolyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated\nexpression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity\nphenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's\ndisease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin,\ntau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in\nthe appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to\nthe proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of\nalternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates.\nA role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with\nmammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that\nthe heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting\na role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4). Moreover, a direct\nrelationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock\nproteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues\nof affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5). Finally, overexpression of\nHsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8). High\nthroughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat\nshock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and\nmay lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine the cytotoxicity of test compounds\nidentified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput\nscreening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)\" (PubChem\nAID 1203) and confirmed activity via dose-response assays entitled, \"Dose response cell-based\nhigh-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70\n(Hsp70)\" (PubChem AID 1252).  The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure\nintracellular ATP found in viable cells.  Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation\nof beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP.  Thus, well luminescence is\ndirectly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability.  As designed, compounds that induce cell\ndeath will reduce ATP levels, and therefore reduce well luminescence.  Compounds were assayed in a\n10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 99 uM.  Compounds active in the\nassays above and inactive in this cytotoxicity counterscreen are considered nontoxic inducers of\nHsp70 transcription.\n\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)\n\nA cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP\nResponse Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to measure S1P2 antagonism.\nUnder normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. In\nthis assay, cells have been stimulated with the S1P agonist, which stimulates the S1P2 receptor,\nhence increasing BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents\nactivation by exogenously added S1P. Therefore, in the presence of a potential S1P2 antagonist,\ntranscription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence\nresonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.\n\nIn this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the human S1P2\nreceptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used.\nCells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).

To the appropriate\nwells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar,\nfinal DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly\nafterwards by 1 microliter of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 750 nanomolar, i.e. a\nconcentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control\n(100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37\ndeg C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 microliter of this mixture was then added\nto each well.\nAfter a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate\nreader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and\nfluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm.\nFluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting \"background\"\nfluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only.\nTo normalize assay data, values measured from both the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths\nwere used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/I535 nm \nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control)/(Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))*100\nWhere:\nLow Control: test wells containing 750 nanomolar of S1P and 3.1 micromolar JTE-013, corresponding\nto 100% antagonism\nHigh Control: test wells containing 750 nanomolar of S1P, corresponding to its EC80 \nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared as an inhibitor. \nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary\ninhibition.

The fusion\nprotein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium\nKryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Agonist ligands\nthat promote the association of SRC1 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities,\nallowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an\nagonist will increase TR-FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride,\n100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22\nmicrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.

Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by\ndispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (10 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM final nominal\nconcentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. Immediately\nafter addition of test compounds fluorescence (t0) was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading\nfluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin\nElmer). The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was\nmeasured again (t15). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK)\nand 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nFor each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated for each timepoint, according to the following\nmathematical expressions:\nt15_Ratio = t15_I671nm / t15_I617nm x 10,000\nWhere I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the\nmeasured fluorescence emission at 617nm.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl -\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl))\nWhere:\nTestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound\nLowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929.\nData were evaluated using % Activation.

The\nplates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute\nincubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final\nconcentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was\nstarted by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm\nemission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence\nmeasurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and;\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation.\nNegative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, for inactive 1-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO-OTR cells (provided by Assay provider)\nOxytocin (Sigma-Aldrich, part 06379)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (ABD Bioquest, part 2456)\nF-12 (Ham) (Invitrogen, part 11765)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation. \nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. \nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.  The primary screen was performed in 384-well format\nwith 194,653 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 219 potential small\nmolecule inhibitors of Rac wt (AID 764).  \nIn the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary\nscreen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and\ndetermine potency.   \nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and\n0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.\nTest compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially\ndiluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final\ncompound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to\n100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM.\nBeads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response\nexperiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras\nconstitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt,\nRac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound\nworklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce\nannotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an\nExcel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and\nthe fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter\n(SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity\n(MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated.\nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine\ndifferent concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data\npoints. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand\nconcentrations, generating competition curves. \nLigand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA)\nusing nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope,\nalso known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the\nfollowing parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor\nthat inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the\nresponse value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE -\nthe slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE -\nstandard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low\nand high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation\ncoefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit.\nIn order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\n- [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be\nstatistically significant)\n- |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of\nLOGEC50)\n- |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test\ncompound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the\ncompound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 -\n||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|)\nIn this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive\ncompounds the activity score is 0.\n" ;

Thus cathepsin L inhibitors\nhave potential as novel anti-viral agents.\nCathepsin L inhibitors may also be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible\nfor human malaria. Plasmodium contains cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases known as falcipains that\nappear to promote virulence of the parasite through haemoglobin digestion and erythrocyte invasion.\nA high-throughput screen for cathepsin L inhibitors was designed as an end-point assay monitoring\nthe release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an\nAMC-labeled dipeptide. Primary HTS results and dose-response confirmation in the presence of DTT\nand cysteine have been reported previously (AIDs 460 and 825).

        bat:hasParagraph  "TR-FRET-based primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization.\n\nThe purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine the ability of test compounds to prevent\ndimerization of the hydrophilic N-terminal domain (residues 1-106; core106) of the HCV core protein\n(9). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and\nFlag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a\nXL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody\nbinding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the\nXL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106\ndimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies, blocking the transfer of energy\nfrom Europium to XL-665, and thus inhibiting well FRET. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate\nat a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM\nDTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were\ndispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with\n2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of\nFlag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5\nmicromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50%\ninhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of test compounds\nor DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2\nmicroliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75\nnM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds\nat 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time,\nTR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm\n(Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final\nvolume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1\nmicrogram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control\nconcentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls,\nrespectively.\nTo normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to\ncalculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = ( I671nm / I617nm ) x 10,000\nWhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of\nthree replicate wells, calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have an activity score range of 0 to 41 and the active\ncompounds have an activity score range of 41 to 100.\nList of Reagents:\nGST-core106 (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFlag-core106 (supplied by Assay Provider)\nUnlabelled core106 peptide (supplied by Assay Provider)\nAnti-Flag Antibody (XL-665 labeled) (Cisbio, part 61FG2XLB)\nAnti-GST Antibody (Europium labeled) (Cisbio, part 61GSTKLB)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789175)\nHEPES (Fisher Scientific, part BP299-500)\nEDTA (Sigma, part E7889)\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 402931)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A9647)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070)\nDTT (Sigma, part 43815)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay for agonists of\nNPY-Y1.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding\nbehavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation.\nImportantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY\nmediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors\n(GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have\nimplicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2),\nanxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling\n(6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and\ntumorigenesis (10). Therefore, the identification and characterization of small molecule modulators\nof NPY signaling and high affinity selective ligands for NPY receptors may prove useful for\nunderstanding NPY-associated human disease.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine Y1 agonist dose response curves for compounds identified\nas active in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for\npotentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID 1304), \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for\npotentiators of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1\"\n(AID 1697),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2 (AID\n1359), and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (AID 1704).\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY.\nThe cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing\ncytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity.\nChanges in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a\nfluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of NPY-Y1 will increase Y1\nactivity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence,\nthus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point,\n1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into\neach well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were\nincubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement\nwas performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular\nDevices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate\nwells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added\nto the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature,\nfollowed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final\nconcentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration).\nThe plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence\nmeasurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge. \nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n- MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere: \nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-75, for inactive 67-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

The compounds selected for\ntesting in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871 and AID\n1267; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high\nthroughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation\" (AID 932); 3) they were inactive in a set\nof experiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput\nassay to measure NF-kappaB activation\" (AID 1309); and 4) they were inactive in a set of\nexperiments entitled, \"Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay\nto measure STAT1 activation\" (AID 1318).\nIn this assay STAT1 activation was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably\nexpresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase\nIFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound,\nfollowed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by\nmeasuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 activator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1\ntranscription, thus increasing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well\nluminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting\nat a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM.\n\nThe activator and inhibitor dose response counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were\nrun simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media\n(DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of\npenicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/ml of neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of\n5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell\nsuspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was\nstarted by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final\nconcentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C\n(5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL final nominal EC80\nconcentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to all wells.  The plates were then incubated\nfor 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of\nSteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at\nroom temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.  \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The purpose of this cell-based reporter assay is to identify compounds that inhibit the expression\nof KLF5. This assay employs a human DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line that is stably transfected\nwith a plasmid containing 2.0 kb of the human KLF5 promoter used to drive expression of the firefly\nluciferase reporter gene (DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p). Cells are seeded in medium supplemented with 10%\nFBS for one day, followed by incubation with test compounds. Luciferase activity is monitored using\na luminescent detection reagent, which contains the luciferase substrate D-luciferin that releases\nlight energy upon conversion to oxyluciferin in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and oxygen. As designed,\ncompounds that inhibit KLF5 expression will reduce the activity of the KLF5 promoter, thereby\nreducing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene and luciferase protein levels, resulting in\ndecreased conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, and reduced well luminescence. Test compounds\nwere assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM.\n\nThe DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v\ncertified fetal bovine serum800 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin,\nstreptomycin, and neomycin).\nPrior to the start of the assay 2500 cells in a 5 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above\nexcept without geneticin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated\nmicrotiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 25 nL of test compound in DMSO\n(0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or LY294002 (200 uM final concentration) to the\nappropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 27 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).\nAfter equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by\ndispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room\ntemperature for 15 minutes.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on\ncellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological\ndisorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the\nprotein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with\nmisfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone\nDnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that\ninhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their\nimportance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel\nantibiotics. \nDnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa\nsubstrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638).\nIt has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of\nchaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good\ntarget for the small organic molecules.\nIn an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the\nsubstrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay, using a construct of DnaK corresponding\nto only the b-domain (residues 393-507), the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to\ndetermine their ability to inhibit the ATPase activity of DnaK.\nReferences\n1.

The gene coding for the E. coli DnaK substrate binding (beta) domain (393-507) was amplified\nwith PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening\nassay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 5 (S1P5).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as antagonists of S1P5. This assay uses\nTango S1P5-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 8 (EDG8; S1P5)\nlinked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a\nbeta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the\ncontrol of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P5 receptor by agonist causes migration of\nthe fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The\nliberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA\nexpression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable,\nfluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P5 antagonists\nwill inhibit S1P5 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of\nGAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in\ntriplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25\nmicromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4\nmicroliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO\nalone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the\nappropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the\nincubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm \nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-61, for inactive 55-0.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy#s 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The pharmacological treatment of neurodegenerative disorders has been a disappointment when\ncompared to the successes obtained in stroke, other neurological diseases like seizures, and in\nmental health diseases. It has to be said that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and\ntheir early diagnosis represent a definite obstacle to effective intervention. \nNuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a key cellular signaling factor in the central nervous system.\nAlthough NF-kB signaling pathways have been extensively investigated in cancer and in immunological\ndiseases, NF-kB role in the central nervous system physiology and pathology in non inflammatory\ndisorders of the brain is still unclear. NF-kB has an important role as an inhibitor of neuronal\napoptosis and at least in this capacity it represents an interesting target to pursue. Recent\nevidence has also pointed out that this signaling system is involved in the resilience of neurons\nand in their ability to survive disparate insults. Functional knock out models of NF-kB, achieved\nvia over-expression of its natural repressor I-kB, have shown that neurons from these animals are\nmore sensitive to insults including trauma, Beta-amyloid toxicity and excitotoxicity. Also a direct\nneuroprotective effect from both non apoptotic and apoptotic models of neurodegeneration has been\nattributed to direct or indirect activation of NF-kB signaling. In addition, to the direct\nneuroprotective effect NF-kB up-regulation could also be of value in improving learning and memory.\nIn fact, NF-kB signaling has been shown to improve long term potentiation and long term depression,\ntwo models of learning at cellular level. This background is of great appeal because up regulation\nof NF-kB in neurons could be useful in attacking, at the same time, neuronal degeneration and\ndeterioration of neuronal functions associated with loss of learning and memory as seen in\nAlzheimer's disease. To pursue this scope, we have set up a novel human cell-based assay to\nidentify small molecules able to up-regulate NF-kB expression for high throughput screening.\nThe cell line developed for this assay, which is used to identify pharmacological probes for the\nactivation of NF-kB, was prepared as follows. The SH-5YSY human neuroblastoma cell line was doubly\nstably transfected with a reporter construct coding the human NF-kB promoter driving the expression\nof the firefly luciferase and a reporter coding the resistance to the antibiotic blasticidin. \nTNF-alpha was used as a positive control as it a potent enhancer of NF-kB expression.  Negative\ncontrol wells were treated with vehicle only.  \nCell Culture:  SH-5YSY (ATCC) cells stably transfected with a reporter construct containing the\nhuman NF-kB promoter fused upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter and blasticidin resistance\n(clone C1) were subcultured every 3-4 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) high glucose\n(1X) with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate + 10% FBS + 3 ug/mL of blasticidin, and incubated at 37C\nin 5% CO2, and maintained at a subconfluent density of no more than 240,000 cells/cm2 for less than\n30 passages.\nCell Culture Reagents used:\n1. D-MEM high glucose (1X), liquid, with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, Invitrogen: 11995-065\n2.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the larger herpesvirus\nfamily that consists of three subfamilies. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an extremely\nprevalent human herpesvirus. Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell types that\nEBV infects, which are primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. Infection of both cell types is\nassociated with a variety of proliferative disorders and cancers. Current treatments for such\nmalignancies are traditional chemotherapy, radiation-therapy, surgery, and if possible, restoration\nof immune system function. Like all herpesviruses, EBV has mechanisms to evade the immune system\nand maintain latency in the human host. A treatment directed specifically against EBV could\nsignificantly improve patient care by limiting initial acute infection and spread of the virus\nbetween cells. Currently there are no inhibitors that block the entry of EBV.\nEBV gH and gL proteins form a heterodimeric complex and are required for membrane fusion with all\nknown EBV-targeted cell types. gp42 is an EBV-encoded protein and is essential for EBV infection of\nB cells. In EBV, gH/gL forms a high affinity complex with gp42 prior to MHC class II binding and\nthe activation of membrane fusion. In B cell fusion, gp42 binding to gH/gL is required for fusion\nactivation. The central role of the EBV gH/gL protein in viral entry into both B cells and\nepithelial cells makes it an attractive target for the development of anti-viral inhibitors.\nTo discover novel small molecule inhibitors of EBV induced membrane fusion and entry, which act by\nblocking essential viral protein interactions, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP)\nbased assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction between the gH/gL protein\nwith a fluorescently labeled peptide derived from gp42 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step\nmix-and-measure method was achieved for analyzing gH/gL protein and gp42 interaction. gH/gL protein\nFP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 1536-well uHTS format with a\ndemonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z### factor of above 0.7. Because of its\nsimplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for ultra high-throughput screening in 1536\nwell format of small molecules that bind directly to EBV gH/gL and block EBV entry.\nPositives from the primary screen, AID 1085, were selected for testing in this confirmatory assay.\n\n1.Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40\n2.gH/gL protein\n3.gp42-36-81 peptide with an N-terminal fluorescein label (gp42-Flu)\nProcedure:\n1.

It is a lysosomal hydrolase that is\nrequired for the degradation of a small percentage (1-3%) of cellular glycogen in human. Deficiency\nof this enzyme results in glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII), also referred to as Pompe\ndisease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Structurally normal glycogen is accumulated in lysosomes\nand cytoplasm in affected patients, primarily in muscle tissues. Excessive glycogen storage within\nlysosomes may interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and leads to cellular injury.

As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration\nof agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the\nopening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A\nfluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an\nincrease or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in cAMP concentration.\nTo measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic\nreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore\nprobe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide\ncounteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor\nantagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher\nfluorescence units. Compounds were tested in triplicate.\n\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nPrior to the start of the assay, 3,600 Y1 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as\nabove) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated\nmicrotiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all\nwells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the\nfirst fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the\nFLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its\nEC95 (25 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 uM final nominal\nconcentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells.\nThe plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul\nof a solution containing isoproterenol (1 micromolar final nominal concentration; EC100) and the\nphosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS. The plates\nwere then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement\nwith the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds\nand challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post\naddition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as\nfollows:\n% Inhibition = [1-((Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_High_Control))]*100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol.\nAny compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated\nfor the Primary screen was declared active.

This\nassay is based on the efficient Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between a GST-PPARg\nligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC3 coactivator. The fusion protein\nand coactivator are recognized by the fluorophore-labeled antibodies, anti-GST Europium Kryptate\n(EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.\nAgonist ligands that promote the association of the SRC-3 coactivator with the fusion protein will\nshorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated\nantibodies complex.

The cascade is initiated by\nthe small G-protein Ras, which recruits Raf from the cytosol, where activation occurs.\nAlternatively, this pathway can be activated by elevating intracellular cAMP.\nActivation of the ERK pathway is essential in increased cell division and cell survival. Sustained\nand constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, however, has been linked to uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, increased cell survival, and tumor progression. Thus, the ERK has been as an\nattractive target for cancer chemotherapy in the past few years (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004).\nGiven its physiological and pathological importance, assessment of ERK phosphorylation has been\nbroadly performed in both basic research and drug discovery. Most assays for the measurement of ERK\nphosphorylation use the antibody-based detection methods, such as western blot and ELISA. These\nassays require multiple reagent additions with cell wash steps and are not suitable for\nhigh-throughput screening.\nThe current cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay was performed using AlphaScreen platform.\nAlphaScreen is a two bead-based proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescent assay\nplatform. The assay reagents (ERK SureFire(TM) kit) were supplied from TGR BioSciences (Australia).\nIn the presence of specific antibodies, phosphorylated ERK will bring \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" beads\nto a proximity range (<200 nm), and subsequently lead a chemical luminescent reaction upon exciting\ndonor beads with 680 nm laser. To validate pathway hits from the cell-based assay, enzyme assays\nconsisting of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Raf and MEK were used as a means of deciphering the enzymes of\ntarget for the prioritized group of compounds derived from the HEK-293 cell based assay. The\ncompounds were tested against  significant members of the ERK signaling pathway EGFR and EGFR\nmutants (EGFR L858R, EGFR T790M, and EGFR L858R T790M). In order to establish the specificity of\nthe prioritized compounds for EGFR and EGFR mutants, the compounds were also assayed against other\nimportant ERK signaling pathway enzymes, c-RAF and MEK-1.\n\nThe HTRF kinase assay (components supplied as kit by Cisbio) was chosen for the EGFR and EGFR\nmutant enzyme assays that applied the time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(TR-FRET) principle. A peptide substrate is labeled with a biotin that can bind to XL665 labeled\nstreptavidin and the anti-phosphoresidue antibody is labeled with Eu+.  Upon phosphorylation of the\nsubstrate, the antibody binds to phosphorylated substrate that enables TR-FRET detection in\nhomogenous assay format.\nEGFR and EGFR\nmutants were obtained from Invitrogen.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human angiotensin II receptor\ntype 1 (AT1). The dose response assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits\noriginally identified in an uHTS luminescent beta-arrestin assay for agonists of the APJ receptor.\nThis AT1 agonist assay utilizes the same luminescent b-Arrestin-based assay readout as the uHTS APJ\nprimary assay. In both assays we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR\nactivation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows\nfor a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the KOR1 receptor. In\nthis system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme\nacceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly\ncomplementing fragment termed ProLin. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand\nstimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the\ncomplementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme\nthat converts substrate to detectable signal.\nThe purpose of this assay confirm hits from \"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the\nAPJ receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 2520.\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS screen for compounds effecting the binding of fluorscent GTP to various Ras-related\nGTPases yielded a number of interesting compounds.  In this assay the compound found to exhibit\nmost specific response on Cdc42 protein was assessed in a dose response manner with different\nconditions than the primary screen.  For this assay, the nascent nucleotides were depleted from the\nprotein prior to the measurement of binding of fluorescent GTP in the presense of test compound in\na 1 milliM MgCl2 buffer (the primary screen were carried out in 1 milliM EDTA buffer).\nThe protein target (GST-Cdc42, 4 microM) is bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C.\nProtein on GSH-beads is depleted of nascent nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA-containing\nbuffer for 20 min at 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% detergent, NP-40, containing HPS\nbuffer, then resuspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM MgCl2, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.\nBinding assays are performed by incubating 50 microL of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for\n2 min with either DMSO, or test compound (6 point 10-fold dilution series 100 nanoM to 10 microM)\nand subsequently adding 50 microL of a fixed concentration (1.5 nanoM) ice cold BODIPY-GTP.\nAssociation of the fluorescent nucleotide is measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer. The flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanometer (FL1)are\nanalyzed by IDLQuery software to determine the median fluorescence per bead population.\nNon-specific binding of the BODIPY-GTP were assessed in the presence of excess non-fluorescent GTP\n(10 microM). \n \nCalculations:\nThe specific binding of fluorescent GTP (SpecMCF) were calculated from the median values measured\nat different test compound concentrations in the presense of blocking, non-fluorescent GTP\n(RawMCFwNFGTP) and DMSO (RawMCFwDMSO):\nSpecMCF = RawMCFwDMSO - RawMCFwNFGTP\nThese specific binding values were normalize to the amount of binding in DMSO alone sample:\n%Response = 100*(SpecMCF/SpecMCFwDMSO)\nwhere SpecMCF is the specific binding of fluorescent GTP at different concentrations of test\ncompound and SpecMCFwDMSO is the specific binding of fluorescent GTP in the presense of DMSO alone.\n \nThe different %Response values were fit to 4-parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable\nslope:\n%Response= Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/(1 +10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope))\nwhere Bottom and Top are estimates of minimum and maximum of %Response over the concentration range\nof test compounds, LogEC50 is the log of the Effective Concentration of test compound yielding 50%\nchange in the %Response, and HillSlope is variable slope of the dose response curve.\nPUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the comparison of the estimated EC50 to the least amount of acceptable\nEC50, 10 microM. Thus PUBCHEM_SCORE = (10-EC50inMicroM)/10 where EC50inMicroM is the calculated\nestimate of EC50 in microM. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_SCORE greater than 50.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors\ntransduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of\ninflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2).  STATs are activated in\nresponse to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases\n(1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are\nphosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear\ntranslocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although\nstructurally similar, the seven STAT family member (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess\ndiverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and\nanti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is\nlargely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved\nin IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus\nSTAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Studies show that STAT3 is activated\nin a majority of breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a\ndominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1, 4, 6). \nBlocking STAT3 interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using peptide aptamers\nhas been shown to reduce tumor growth (7).  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes\nassociated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective potentiators of STAT3 activity may\nlead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as\nactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening\nassay to measure STAT3 activation\" (PubChem AID 871). The compounds selected for testing in this\nAID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871; 2) they were\ndeclared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput\nscreening assay to measure STAT1 activation\" (PubChem AID 932).\nIn this assay activation of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell\nline that stably expresses a human STAT3-luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in\nSTAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase\nreporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to\nactivate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring\nwell luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 potentiator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3\ntranscription, thus enhancing the activity of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing well\nluminescence.\n\nThe STAT3 potentiator and antagonist confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  U3A cells were\ngrown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal\nbovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100\nmicrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell\nsuspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The assay was\nstarted by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in\nDMSO to sample wells, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to High Control wells.  The plates\nwere then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 28 nL of nifuroxazide (100\nuM final concentration in DMSO) were added to a subset of control wells, to monitor that the assay\nwas functioning properly.  Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/mL final nominal\nconcentration) was dispensed into sample and control wells.  The plates were then incubated for 6\nhours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS\nluciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature\nfor 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.\n" ;

The SMN locus on chromosome 5q13 contains two inverted copies of SMN called SMN1 and SMN2\nwhich are 99% identical at the amino acid level. SMN1 is a fully functional protein and SMN2 skips\nexon 7 90% of the time. Skipping of exon 7 produces non-functional protein product. 10% of the SMN2\nprotein includes exon 7 and is fully functional. In the SMA disease state, mutations in the SMN1\nlocus are the cause of the disease state. Because only 10% of SMN2 is of the fully functional form,\nit is not sufficient to overcome the deficiency produced by the loss of the SMN1 product. A therapy\nthat either increase the amount of SMN2 product made or to increase the inclusion of exon 7 has\nbeen proposed for the treatment of SMA.\nWe have designed an assay to identify small molecules that can increase the amount of functional\nSMN2 product by appending a luciferase reporter gene after the native SMN2 gene, such that\ninclusion of exon 7 in the expressed product places the luciferase sequence in frame, thus\ngenerating functional luciferase enzyme.\nAs a counterscreen for nonspecific modulators of expression, we have run compounds through a\nsimilar assay that measures expression of an SMN1-luciferase chimera.\n\nThis screen utilizes a luciferase reporter gene assay, combining the promoter with the major\nportion of the native SMN1 cDNA (exons 1 -7, intron 8 , exon 8 fused to luciferase) stably\nexpressed in HEK293 cells.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive\nbehaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include\ncomponents of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While\nthe addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at\ndifferent receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role\nregulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal\nsubstances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to\naddictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single\nreceptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures.\nThus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing\nnovel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a\ngiven receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as\nvariations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling\nbehaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid\nligand with distinctive signaling properties. \nThe specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the\nhuman kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological\nmeans to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype.

EC20) was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay\nbuffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25C using a\nFLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were\npreincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist,\nacetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal ACh concentration (ca.\nEC20).  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the\nmaximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for each compound were determined using GraphPad\nPrism (4.0c), which fit curves using standard non-linear regression (variable slope). None of the\ncompounds were active against human M2/Gqi5 in the calcium flux assay at a compound concentration\nof 30uM. All compounds were assigned and 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis\n\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01%\nNP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. \nBeads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke\nScientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied\nmagnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are\nlocated in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. \n\nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.\nFlow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence\nemission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The\nresulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine\nthe compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated\nwith different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. \nCalculations:\n\nIn order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a\nwell.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. \nCompounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned\na PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RacWT there are only 67\nmissing compounds.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible Green Fluorescent Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT) and the results from a fluorescent compound is considered to be\n'inconclusive' (PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 3, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0).  Assessment of\nfluorescent compound is made by comparing the influence of compound fluorescence on all the\nproteins in one well.  Difference between Sample fluorescence and Positive Control fluorescence are\ncalculated for all the different proteins in a well.  The following equation describes this\ndifference (CompoundFLinRacWT) for RacWT;\nCompoundFLinRacWT = RacWTSampleFL - PCntrlRacWTFL \nwith RacWTSampleFL being the Sample fluorescence and PCntrlRacWTFL the Positive Control\nfluorescence of RacWT coated beads. Next, the coefficient of variation (CV) of all these CompoundFL\nfrom the different protein beads (RacWT, Rab7, RacACT, RasWT, Rab2, Cdc) in the same well are\ncalculated.  If the CV was less than 30%, meaning the compound attributed fluorescence was very\nsimilar between all the different proteins, then the compound was flagged as a potential\nfluorescent compound.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for RacWT there are only 4,083 fluorescent\ncompounds.\nDue to potential systematic trends in data over the entire plate (whole plate trends),\nnormalization is utilized to calculate the percent activity of the test compound.  Whole plate\ntrends of the positive controls are evaluated by linear regression.  Then due to the plate location\nof a sample, a calculated Positive Control value (notated with WPcalc) is utilized for calculating\n% activity normalized by whole plate:\n% Activity = 100 x (SampleFL - NCntrl)/(PCntrl_WPcalc -NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are Median Fluorescence Intensity associated with the bead set bound with a\nspecific protein.  SampleFL is for beads in wells containing test compound, PCntrl_WPcalc is the\nwell-specific, calculated value based on whole plate linear regression of wells without test\ncompounds, and NCntrl is for measurement in presence 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP.  Baseline of % Activity\nis 100%.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of Wee1 degradation. The\nassay uses HeLa cells transfected with a kinase negative mutant of Wee1 (Wee1K328M) fused to a\nluciferase reporter gene. As designed, compounds that increase Wee1K328M-luciferase stability\nand/or prevent its degradation will lead to increased well luminescence compared to untreated\nwells. Specifically, compounds that increase luminescence are considered Wee1 degradation\ninhibitors.\n\nHeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's\nModified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%\npen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture (PSN) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). HeLa cells were transiently transfected in T75 flasks by mixing 6 million\ncells with 29 micrograms of the Luc::Wee1K328M plasmid complexed with 87 microliters of TransIT-LT1\nreagent in a final volume of 24 mL of a 1:1 mix of OptiMEM and 2X supplemented DMEM, according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 48 hours. Next, the\ntransfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 15 to 20 million cells per\nmL in freezing media (growth media containing 10% DMSO), aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at\n-80 degrees C until needed.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were thawed, centrifuged and resuspended in growth media at\na concentration of 800,000 cells per mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each\nwell of 1536-well plates (4,000 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 25 nL of test compound (final nominal 5 uM\nconcentration) to sample wells, DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) to Low Control wells, or the\nproteasome inhibitor MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set as 100% activation) to\nHigh Control wells. The plates were then incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).\nThe assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well,\nfollowed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux\nplate reader." ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport.  This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases.  Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers.  Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions.  Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors.  To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation. \nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated.  Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. \nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members.  Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.  The primary screen was performed in 384-well format\nwith 194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small\nmolecule inhibitors of Rac wt (AID 761).  \nIn the dose response study, the compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary\nscreen (change in % activity greater than 20% from baseline) were tested to confirm activity and\ndetermine potency.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and\n0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.\nTest compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 milliM in DMSO, then serially\ndiluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO.  Final\ncompound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM.  These dilutions were then diluted 1 to\n100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100 microM.\nBeads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response\nexperiments reported here include one multiplex format for: Rab7wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras\nconstitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42 constitutively active, and 3 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt,\nRac1 constitutively active and GST-GFP.    \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with  the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates.   \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound\nworklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data are parsed in IDLeQuery to produce\nannotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data are then processed through an\nExcel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and\nthe fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter\n(SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission\ndistinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity\n(MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated.\nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine\ndifferent concentrations of compound, from 10 nanoM to 100 microM, to produce a series of 9 data\npoints. IDLeQuery calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand\nconcentrations, generating competition curves. \nLigand competition curves were fitted by Prism(R) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA)\nusing nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope,\nalso known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the\nfollowing parameters of the model: EC50, microM - concentration of added test compound competitor\nthat inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the\nresponse value at the top plateau; BOTTOM - the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE -\nthe slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE -\nstandard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low\nand high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation\ncoefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit.\nIn order to be considered active and get a score > 0, the compounds have to pass the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\n- [TOP - STD_TOP] > [BOTTOM + STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be\nstatistically significant)\n- |LOGEC50| > STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of\nLOGEC50)\n- |HILLSLOPE| > STD_HILLSLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM] scavenger < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test\ncompound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\n- [TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for GST-GFP < 0.5*[TOP - BOTTOM]/TOP for the target (the interference of the\ncompound with the GST/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation;\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 1000 * (-4 - LOGEC50)/4 * [(TOP-STD_TOP)-(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]/TOP * (1 -\n||HILLSLOPE|-1|) * (1-STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50|)\nIn this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive\ncompounds the activity score is 0.\n" ;

Compounds that cause a\nreduction in luciferase expression will be compared to their activity in the primary screening line\nto eliminate false positive hits due to off target effects. Assays were conducted in 384-well\nformat (Corning, 3570) with a 3000 cells/well coating density in 50 uL phenol red-free DMEM with\n4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine\n(Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen,\n10131-027). Following overnight growth, 100 nL of compound was added to each well.  Compounds were\ntested in 8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions.  Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM,\nwhile final compound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.

The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and luciferase\nlevels were measured.\n1) H4 neuroglioblastoma cells stably transfected with the pGL-3 LUC gene fusion were grown to\nconfluency in 35 mL complete media (DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-614Q) supplemented with\n10% FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E)\nand 200 ug/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) in a T175 TC flask (BD Falcon, 353112) in a TC\nincubator (37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2) (doubling time = 24 h).\n2) Cells were harvested by washing the monolayer quickly with 5 mL trypsin/EDTA (1X, Cellgro,\n25-053-Cl), aspirating, then adding 5 mL trypsin/EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37C, 95%\nhumidity, 5% CO2. Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down. This\n10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3\nmin at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge. The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was\nresuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media. Cells were then counted and expanded (see below).\n3) Cells were expanded by plating 2x10^6 cells in 50 mL complete media per T225 flask and allowing\n72 h for cells to grow to confluency.\n4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol\nred-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E),\n200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM Pen-Strep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin\n(Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media\nprewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles.\n5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 100 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50\nuL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized\ndispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood.\n6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX\n2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight.\n7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions). Each run was initiated in\nCBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario software (HiRes\nBiosolutions). Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system.\nReplicate assay plates were delidded and then pinned with 100 nL compound, which were tested in\n8-pt dose at 2-fold dilutions. Compound stock concentrations spanned 6.25 mM to 24 uM, while final\ncompound concentrations in the assay plates spanned 12.5 uM to 48.8 nM.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins.\nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors.\nThe present assay uses an orthogonal technique to identify those compounds specifically interacting\nwith the target protein.\nNMR samples for the saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments contained 2.5uM  menin\nsolution in 50 mM phosphate buffer, 50 mM NaCl,  1mM DTT, pH= 7.5, with 5% of D2O, final volume 150\nuL. The compounds were added as stock solutions in DMSO to final 100 uM concentration and 5% DMSO.\nAll NMR experiments were recorded using 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer at 25C. Samples for\nthe competition STD experiments contained additional MBM1 peptide at final concentration of 25 uM\nand the measurements were carried out is the same way as described above for STD experiments. \n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "TR-FRET counterscreen for FAK inhibitors: dose-response biochemical high throughput screening\nassay to identify inhibitors of Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of\nFocal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)\" (PubChem AID 727), that confirmed activity in a set of experiments\nentitled, \"Confirmation biochemical assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)\" (PubChem\nAID 794), and that were active in a set of experiments entitled, \"Dose-response biochemical assay\nfor inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)\" (PubChem AID 810), were nonselective inhibitors due\nto inhibition of PYK2.\nIn this time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based assay, PYK2-mediated\nphosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate is monitored using a FRET acceptor dye which\nis coupled directly to the substrate. Substrate phosphorylation by PYK2 is detected with a specific\neuropium-labeled anti-phospho-tyrosine PY20 antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon\nphosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to phosphorylated tyrosines of the substrate\nbring the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, allowing FRET to occur. As designed, a\ncompound that acts as a PYK inhibitor will prevent PYK2-mediated substrate phosphorylation, thereby\npreventing the binding of the Eu-Ab to phospho-tyrosine residues and well FRET. Compounds were\ntested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test\nconcentration of 70 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 2.5 ul/well of a solution containing 200 nM ULight poly GT (4:1)\nsubstrate and 60 uM ATP in kinase buffer were dispensed into black 1536-well solid bottom\nnon-treated microtiter plates. Next, 35 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.7% final\nconcentration) or staurosporine (143 uM IC100 (1 uM Final) concentration) were then added to the\nappropriate wells.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 2.5 ul of 200 nM PYK2 enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10\nmM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH 7.0) . After 30 minutes of incubation at room\ntemperature, 5 ul of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM EDTA and 4 nM\nEu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room\ntemperature. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm\n(ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer).\nTo normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to\ncalculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of\nthree replicate wells, calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl -\nMedian_Ratio_HighControl)))*100\nWhere:\nTestCompound = Wells containing test compound.\nLowControl = Wells containing DMSO.\nHighControl = Wells containing staurosporine.\nFor each compound percent inhibition was plotted against test compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 70 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually. Compounds with IC50 of\ngreater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 equal to or less than 10\nuM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 39 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 40 to 100. \nList of Reagents:\nATP (Sigma-Aldrich, part A6559)\nHEPES solution (Invitrogen, part 15630-114)\nMgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, part M4880-100g)\nEGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, part E8145)\nTween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, part p7949)\nULight poly GT (4:1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, part TRF0100)\nPYK2 activated enzyme (Biomol, part SE450)\nEu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, part AD0066)\n10X LANCE Detection buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, part CR97-100)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.\nBased on the original inhibition hit MLS000091369, a synthetic plan was carried out by the\nUniversity of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center exploring both substitution on the peripheral\nphenyl groups as well as modification to the chain length between the oxadiazole and the\npiperazinyl-carboxamide linker. Later modification to the substructure core included exploring\nother heterocycles in place of the oxadiazole as well as replacement of the piperazine with\npiperidine.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

GPR55, an orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, has been reported\nto be a cannabinoid receptor, but its status as such remains unresolved due to conflicting results\nfrom pharmacological studies.  The goal of the project is to identify small molecule agonists of\nGPR55, which may aid in the deorphanization efforts of this receptor and ultimately further the\nunderstanding of the role of GPR55 in drug addiction.\nThis high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and an enhanced GPR55 receptor.

The assay uses HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid that encodes a cyclin\nB-luciferase fusion protein to monitor cyclin B levels.  The cyclin B-luciferase complex is rapidly\nturned over in these cells. As designed, compounds that inhibit cyclin B degradation will increase\ncyclin B-luciferase stability, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in\ntriplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM.\n\nHeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's\nModified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%\npen-strep-neo antibiotic mixture at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism\nafter an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293\nTrex D1 cell line.\n\nFreshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000\ncells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer.

In this assay, recombinant GSTO1 protein is incubated with\ntest compounds and a Rh-conjugated sulfonate ester (SE) activity-based probe. The reaction is\nexcited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the\npolarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as GSTO1 inhibitors will prevent\nGSTO1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in\nthe well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final\nnominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris\nHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 1.25 micromolar of GSTO1-1 protein were dispensed\ninto 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final\nconcentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees\nCelsius.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM PS-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all\nwells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Prior to reading,\nplates were equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Fluorescence polarization was read for\n30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular) on a Viewlux microplate reader\n(PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror\n(excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained\nvia the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )\nWhere:\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 and DMSO.\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 in the presence of test compound.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing no GSTO1-1 enzyme.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-17, for inactive 17-0.\nList of Reagents:\nRecombinant GSTO1-1 (supplied by Assay Provider)\nPS-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider)\nTris HCl (Sigma, part T3038)\nNaCl (Sigma, part S6546)\nPluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176)\nDTT (Sigma, part D9779)\n" ;

The assay was\nperformed in a \"duplex\" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat\nBasophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing\ncells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the\nFPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the\nlysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that\nbound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to\nFPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the\nfluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.\nPreviously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR)\nwere screened to identity FPRL1 ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID\n520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary\nintracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule\nFPRL1 antagonists. In the present analysis, 2 major chemotype families representing the most potent\nFPRL1 ligands (inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure\nactivity relationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of\ncomputational screening techniques (2D substructure search) to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv\ncollection of more than 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased for physical screening.\nThe FPRL1 primary HTS assay was performed in 384 well format. Test compounds were assessed at a\nsingle concentration ranging from 3.9 to 8.3 microM (mean +- SD = 5.5 +- 0.8 microM) for the\nability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to\ndisplacement of fluorescent ligand from FPRL1. \n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\n" ;

Following a\npre-incubation of 6 minutes at room temperature, 15 nL of oxytocin (EC potentiator challenge) in\nDMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration, EC100) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the\nappropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495\nnm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a\nreal time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the\nassay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC potentiator challenge) and test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC potentiator challenge) and DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC100) and DMSO.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 29.9 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 29.9 uM. \nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO-OTR cells (provided by Assay provider)\nOxytocin (Sigma-Aldrich, part 06379)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (AAT Bioquest, part 2456)\nF-12 (Ham) (Invitrogen, part 11765)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, part 159910)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

Inhibition of 15hLO-1 activity was screened by utilizing arachidonic acid as a\nsubstrate. The extent of hydroperoxide product formation was measured by a secondary chromogenic\nreaction in which xylenol orange (XO, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. number 39,818-7) reacts with the ferric\nions produced from the reaction between the hydroperoxide and ferrous ions. The Fe(III)-XO complex\nis characterized with red-shifted absorbance at 560 nm.

        bat:hasParagraph  ".Measurement of TR-FRET detection format artefact in the screen for agonists of steroid\nreceptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\n(PPARgamma).\n\nThis assay complements a previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary Biochemical High Throughput\nScreening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)\" (PubChem AID 731). Since the positive\ncontrol agonist, GW1929, exhibited time resolved-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)\nactivity only after several hours of incubation with the SRC-3/PPARgamma complex, a sample well\nthat exhibited TR-FRET activity immediately after initiation of the SRC-3/PPARgamma assay most\nlikely was the result of format-specific artefact. Therefore, this assay's specific purpose is to\nidentify sample wells that possess this artefact, thus indicating that compounds in those wells may\nhave an erroneous activity assignment in AID 731.\nThis assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion\nprotein and a FLAG-tagged SRC3 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized\nby fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG\nAllophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  A high ratio in sample well measured immediately\nafter addition of compound suggests TR-FRET assay format artefact.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium\nFluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH7.0, filtered at\n0.22 micrometer) were dispensed column 1-2 of the 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns\nwere filled with five microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST\nEuK, 3 ug/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged\nSRC-3 protein [aa 601-762].  Next, the microplates were centrifuged for 30s at 300g.  The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM\nfinal nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. \nImmediately after centrifugation fluorescence was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading\nfluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin\nElmer).  Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well,\naccording to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000\nWhere,\n I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617nm represents the measured\nfluorescence emission at 617nm.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally fluorescent compounds.\nTwo values were calculated: (1) the average Ratio of all compounds tested, and (2) three times\ntheir standard deviation.  The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter.   Any\ncompound that exhibited greater fluorescence than the cutoff parameter was flagged as a possible\nTR-FRET artefact. \nList of reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part 449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part  C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part  71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part  A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part  AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part  P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762] (produced by Dr. Scott Busby, Scripps Florida).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part   K1536SBSN)\n" ;

The role of relaxin is well-established in female reproduction and parturition, mammary\ngland and endometrial development, maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Relaxin\nsignaling through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) RXFP1 results in ECM remodeling through\nregulation of collagen deposition, cell invasiveness, proliferation and overall tissue homeostasis.\nSignificantly, the therapeutic effects of relaxin in the treatment of renal, cardiac, skin, lung\nfibrosis, inflammation, and wound healing in animal models are well-established. Recombinant human\nrelaxin (rhRlx) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a protective agent in congestive\nheart failure, in treating severe preeclampsia, and as an anti-fibrotic agent in systemic\nsclerosis.\nUpon relaxin binding RXFP1 activation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs.\ncAMP will activate PKA, which phosphorylates many signaling proteins. Thus, detection of cAMP\nincrease is an easy and reliable indication of relaxin receptor activation. To screen for agonists\nof the relaxin receptor, a HEK293T cell line stably transfected with RXFP1 was used. RXFP1\nactivation was assayed by changes in cAMP levels as detected with a time-resolved fluorescence\nenergy transfer (TR-FRET) cAMP detection kit.\nThis assay measures activation of a cell expressing RXFP2, another GPCR targeted by relaxin, to\ndetermine the selectivity of compounds for RXFP1.\n\nThis is a cell-based assay for cAMP second messenger response to screen for agonists of the RXFP2\nreceptor. The assay was conducted in the presence of a PDE4 inhibitor (Ro 20174). The cells were\nlysed and the cAMP levels were measured with a TR-FRET cAMP kit. Presence of cAMP in the cell\nlysate disrupts binding between the cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP pair, leading to\na decrease in the TR-FRET signal.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Beta-glucocerebrosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide.\nThe inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase results in Gaucher disease, which is\ncharacterized by a wide variety of symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia,\nbony lesions and bone marrow infiltration with characteristic storage cells, known as Gaucher\ncells. There are also forms of the disorder affecting the central nervous system. Patients with the\nsame genotypes can manifest with diverse clinical presentations and it is believed that improper\nfolding and trafficking of beta-glucocerbrosidase may contribute to the phenotypes observed.\nLow molecular weight molecules, acting as chaperones, may potentially restore trafficking of\nmisfolded beta-glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes, thereby\nenhancing functional lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity.\n\nUsing normal beta-glucocerebrosidase, an assay was developed to screen for small molecule\ninhibitors that could potentially act as molecular chaperones on the mutant forms. \nTwo pro-fluorescent substrates were chosen for\ntwo screens against a small molecule library. One beta-glucocerebrosidase assay used Resorufin\nbeta-D-Glucopyranoside (Marker Gene Technology Inc.), generating a red fluorescent product. The\nsecond assay used Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside, generating a blue fluorescent product. The\nKm for the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside and Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside were\ndetermined to be 71.2 uM and 855 uM, respectively. The IC50 values of Conduritol B Epoxide, a known\nglucocerebrosidase inhibitor, were determined to be 87.5 uM and 117 uM, respectively. The use of\ntwo difference pro-fluorescent substrates in the screens helped to eliminate false positives. All\ncompounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s).\n\nBoth enzyme and substrate were diluted in buffer composed of 50mM citric acid/KH2PO4, 10mM sodium\ntaurocholate and 0.01% tween-20 at pH 5.9. The final concentration of the enzyme was 0.2 nM in both\nassays. The compound library was titrated in 7 to 15 concentrations for the primary screens with a\nfinal concentration ranging from 0.6 nM to 50 uM.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based counterscreen for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2: cell-based\nhigh-throughput dose response assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1.\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with diverse physiologic roles including control of\nfeeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional\nregulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and\nalcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor,\na 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production.\nNPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus\nsolitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1, 2). Due to its expression profile\nand biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is\npredicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission,\nY2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this\nhypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type\ncontrols (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been shown to suppress\nethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure\nand high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6).\nTherefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set\nof experiments entitled, \"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or\nagonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID 1359), \"Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for\npotentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2\" (AID 1539),\nand inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1\" (AID\n1304), and \"Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2:\ncell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannel (CNGC) activity\" (PubChem AID 1703), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y1.\nIn this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used\nto measure potentiation of the EC10 NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1\nreceptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore\nincreasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence\nCNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured\nusing a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y1 potentiator or agonist\nwill increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe\nfluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using\na 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium\nPyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and\n1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600\nY1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed\ninto each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the\nplates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by\ndispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the\nplates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence\nmeasurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra\n(Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (75 pM final\nconcentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or\nDMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at\nroom temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at\nits EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in\nPBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room\ntemperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings.\nThe following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:\nRatio = T45 / T0\nWhere:\nT0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and\nchallenge and;\nT45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds\nand challenge.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using:\n% Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control\n- MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol.\nLow_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol.\nFor each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM.\nCompounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-100, for inactive compounds 80-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNeuropeptide Y receptor Y1 HEK293-CNG cells (BD Biosciences, part 344869)\n10x ACTOne Membrane Potential Assay Kit (BD Biosciences, part BD354663)\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (Invitrogen, part 10010-023)\nFatty Acid-Free Bovine Serum Albumin (Calbiochem, part 126609)\nDMEM (Invitrogen, part 11965-092)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nPuromycin (Sigma, part P9620)\nRo 20-1724 (Sigma, part B8279)\nIsoproterenol (Sigma, part I6504)\nNeuropeptide Y (American Peptide, part 60-1-11B)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The high-throughput screen for complement factor C1s inhibitors reported here consisted of an\nend-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic\nhydrolysis of an AMC-labeled tripeptide. The MLSCN compound library was screened as mixtures of 10\ncompounds per well and active compounds were confirmed by single compound IC50 determination.\n\nOne of our goals at the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery (PCMD) is to develop capabilities for\nscreening multiple members of target classes, for example serine and cysteine proteases. Many HTS\nlabs focus effort on one target of interest within a class due to resource and time constraints. A\nfew compounds are then tested for selectivity against additional target class members during the\nhit-to-lead process. Our goal is to test the entire MLSCN compound library against multiple serine\nand cysteine proteases to obtain a profile of activity against these enzymes classes. This profile\nmay then be used to immediately identify selective compounds during subsequent screening of novel\nenzyme targets. It may also be possible to identify a subset of the library with an enhanced hit\nrate towards these enzyme families that might provide the basis for gene family screening.\nOne strategy that enables the rapid screening of multiple targets is to screen compound mixtures.\nWe chose to evaluate an orthogonal pooling strategy that gives 10 compounds per well, as described\nin detail below. An advantage of this method is that each compound is in two plates, mixed with a\ndifferent set of 9 other compounds at each location. This duplication improves the HTS statistics\nand greatly simplifies deconvolution of the results as activity in both wells containing a given\ncompound immediately identifies that compound as a hit. This method has been used with some success\nin several pharmaceutical companies.\n\nComplement factor C1s (0.02 mg/mL) was incubated with Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC substrate (15 uM) in 10\nuL of assay buffer (see above) for 2.5 hr at room temperature.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Currently there are no small molecule tools to investigate the biological functions of apelin and\nits receptor. Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ\n(angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an\norphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate\ncyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1.\nHowever, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the\napelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic\nlesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional\nresearch has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this\ncomplex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there\nremains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and\npathology. \nThe project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and\nreversibly activates the receptor. An antagonist or inhibitor receptor activation would provide a\nnovel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease\npathology.\nIn this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation.\nUnlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct\nmeasure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system,\nb-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA)\nand the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment\ntermed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in\nthe interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two\nb-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to\ndetectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor\nresulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.\nThis assay is a follow-up to \"uHTS identification of small molecule antagonists of the APJ \nreceptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay\", AID 2521 and Single concentration confirmation of\nuHTS hits from a small molecule antagonists of the APJ  receptor  via a luminescent beta-arrestin\nassay\nA.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Prostaglandin E2 that is produced by COX2 in response to cellular injury is involved in a\nmultimodal inflammatory response in many tissues, including the brain.  Studies in rodents have\ndemonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) activation following ischemia and status epilepticus\ngenerally contributes to neuroinflammation, possibly in part via activation of EP2, a Gs-coupled\nGPCR that, when activated, causes an increase in the cellular content of cAMP. However, EP2\ninhibitors that could be used to test this hypothesis are not available. We created a rat C6 glioma\ncell line that stably expresses human EP2 prostanoid receptors under control of the CMV promoter.\nThirteen subclones were expanded and tested for the ability of 1 uM butaprost (a selective EP2\nagonist) and 20 uM forskolin (strong activator of adenylate cyclase) to cause cAMP accumulation in\nthe presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. The subclone chosen for further study\nresponded to 1 uM butaprost with a 1000-fold increase in cAMP levels (from 0.057 to 58 fmoles /\n6000 cells in a 384 well plate). The parent C6 glioma does not respond to butaprost or the\nendogenous ligand, PGE2 (not shown).\nThe primary cell-based assay depends upon competition by cell-derived cAMP for binding of a\ncAMP-labeled FRET acceptor to a cAMP antibody, which is itself labeled with a FRET donor (HTRF\nassay from CisBio). The FRET signal decreases as cAMP concentration rises. Incubation of cells with\nbutaprost in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, reduces the FRET signal in\na concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the assay was stable when this incubation was\ncarried out for 10 or 40 min at room temperature, which provides a comfortable time window for\nmanipulating cell culture plates in this assay. The FRET signal itself was stable for at least 12\nhours after lysing the cells. \nA cell density of 2000 to 4000 cells/well in a 1536-well plate yielded optimum screening metrics.\nThe assay tolerates up to about 2% DMSO. The natural agonist, PGE2, is approximately 7-fold more\npotent than butaprost, and was used in HTS because the action of allosteric modulators is\nfrequently influenced by the agonist chosen. The primary screen involved incubation of cells with\n20 uM of library compounds, followed by a 30-40 min incubation with a saturating concentration (1\nuM) of PGE2. The percent inhibition of the PGE2-induced reduction in TR-FRET signal was measured.\nReagents:\nCell culture medium:  500 ml DMEM high glucose medium, 50 ml FBS (10% heat-inactivated), 5 ml Pen\nStrept, 15 ml 50 mg/ml  Geneticin\nProcedure:\n1.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by\ntracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line.\nFreshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000\ncells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight\nincubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD\nBioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. Agonist read: A 10 cycle (1\nsecond/cycle) baseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of\ncompound library (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically\nat 1 cycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg,\ncompounds which activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential\nagonists).  Following the 180 second read, 1 ul of either an EC20 (positive modulation assay) or\nEC80 (negative modulation assay) is delivered by an onboard pipette head.

In this counterscreen assay a\nCHO cell line stable transfected with V1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium\nindicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to\nmonitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds that act as V1 activators will\nincrease calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative fluorescence of the indicator dye,\nleading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 3.0 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10%\nv/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of\n1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23\nhours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1\nmM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The\nplates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute\nincubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final\nconcentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was\nstarted by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm\nemission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence\nmeasurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n% Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control -\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation.\nNegative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, for inactive 1-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO-V1R cells (provided by Assay provider)\nVasopressin (Sigma-Aldrich, part V9879)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (ABD Bioquest, part 2456)\nF-12 (Ham) (Invitrogen, part 11765)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

Test compounds\nwere assessed at a single concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand\nbinding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from\nFPR. \nThe FPRL1 primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported\nseparately (AID 441) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and\nspecificity of compounds with FPR binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPR binding\nresults reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and\nspecificity of compounds identified to have FPRL1 binding activity in the FPRL1 primary HTS assay\nreport (AID 441)\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).  fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ionizing radiation (IR) and inter-strand cross-linking agents (ICL) induce DNA double-stranded\nbreaks (DSB). DSB are the most harmful type of DNA damage, which cause genome instability, cancer,\ngenetic diseases, and premature aging. The system of homologous recombination (HR) is responsible\nfor repair of DSB repair in all organisms including humans. Therefore, HR acts primarily as a tumor\nsuppressor. However, HR may also protect cancer cells against IR and ICL that are commonly used in\nanti-cancer therapy. In addition, HR is required for cell proliferation, the function of which is\nessential for tumorigenesis. Consequently, we propose to specifically inhibit HR during anti-cancer\ntherapy by targeting hRad51, a key HR protein. hRad 51 has a unique activity: it promotes a search\nfor homologous DNA sequences and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, a basic step\nof HR. However, the mechanism of DNA strand exchange remains unknown. Specific inhibitors and\nstimulators of proteins are especially useful in determining the mechanism of enzymatic reactions.\nOur goal is to identify specific modulators (inhibitors and stimulators), which can be used as\nchemical probes for analysis of the hRad51 mechanism and for development of novel anti-cancer\ntherapies.\nDNA strand exchange of hRad51 with fluorescently-labeled DNA substrates. To measure the hRad51\nprotein DNA strand exchange activity, a fluorimetric assay based on FRET was developed. In this\nassay, dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides\n(47-mers): one containing fluorescein, a donor fluorophore with the excitation maximum at 490 nm\nand the emission maximum at 521 nm, at the 5'-end, and another containing black hole quencher 1\n(BHQ1), a nonfluorescent acceptor, at the 3'-end. Since direct transfer of energy decreases with\nthe sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores, the annealing of two complementary\noligonucleotides increased direct energy transfer from donor to acceptor and thereby quenched the\nphoton emission from the donor fluorescein group. The expected result of DNA strand exchange was an\nincrease in fluorescence because displacement of the fluorescein carrying ssDNA strand from the\nduplex containing the quencher results in separation of the fluorescein and quencher groups. DNA\nstrand exchange was initiated by addition of the dsDNA substrate to the hRad51 nucleoprotein\nfilament that was formed on the non-fluorescent ssDNA identical in sequence to the\nfluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. Inhibitors would be picked up as compounds that inhibit this\nfluorescence.\nWe have completed the HTS on ~200000 compounds (AID 1385). Hits identified were ordered from DPI\nand their dose-response is reported here.\nMaterials\nHuman Rad 51 protein, labeled ss & ds DNA were provided by the assay provider. The fluorescence\nassay was carried out in 384-well black, low-volume plates from Corning (Cat # 3676). All buffer\nsalts were from Sigma.\nAssay\nhRad 51 protein was incubated with ss DNA to allow filament formation (37 deg C for 15 min).\nCompounds (8.5 uM final concentration) were pre-incubated with the protein for 30 min. followed by\naddition of ds DNA to initiate strand exchange. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room\ntemperature for 15 min and then plates were read on Envision plate reader.\nDose response protocol\n1.Serial dilute single compounds at in DMSO (16 two-fold dilutions from 2.5 mM to 75 nM)\n2.Fill 384 well plate with 4 uL of water (nuclease-free) using Multidrop\n3.Pin Tool compound into the plates using 384 pin-tool\n4.

Add 2 ul ds DNA\n7.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min\n8.Read fluorescence on Envision reader (Ex: 485 nm; Em: 520 nm)\nData analysis\nIC50 plates contained compounds in columns 3-22, controls (DMSO, no compound) in columns 2 and 24,\nand blanks (heterologous DNA) in columns 1 and 23. Each column 3-22 contained 16 two-fold dilutions\nof a single compound, ranging in concentration from 85 uM to 2.5 nM. Percent activity was\ncalculated for each dilution of each compound from the signal in fluorescence units (FU) and the\nmean of the plate controls and the mean of the plate blanks using the following equation:\n% Activity = 100*((signal-blank mean)/(control mean-blank mean))\nDose response curves of percent activity were fit using XLfit equation 205 (four parameter logistic\nfit with maximum percent activity and minimum percent activity fixed at 100 and 0, respectively).\n" ;

As with the primary run, SEW-2871 was used as the positive control. All data reported\nwas normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar\nSEW-2871 (i.e. 100% agonist) Vs wells that contained forskolin only (0% agonist). \nDose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal\nconcentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The\nreported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50%\nactivity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (95 micromolar) did\nnot result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually\ndepending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values\nof greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10\nmicromolar are considered active.\n\nIn addition to determining the Ec50 values for the #potentiator assay#, Ec50 values were also\ndetermined for the S1P1 assay in #Agonist# mode as well as counterscreened for EC50 values in the\nparental CHO Cre Bla cell line. These three assay results are submitted as individual publications.\nFor the S1P1 agonist assay execution, all parameters are identical to the #potentiator# assay\nexcept test wells only include forskolin devoid of the Ec20 concentration of SEW 2871. For the\nparental CHO Cre Bla cell counterscreen assay all parameters were again identical to the\n#potentiator assay except this cell line doesn#t express S1P1 and was tested in the presence of 4uM\nforskolin only. Ec50#s for these two assays were plotted using the same parameters as above. For\nthe agonist assay, data was normalized to the 1micromolar SEW-2871 Vs forskolin only and for the\nparental cell counterscreen, data was normalized to untreated cells Vs forskolin treated cells.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n\nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next\nday, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and\nSEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar\n(forskolin#s EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871#s EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871\nwas also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e.\nits EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1\nmicroliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer part#K1085),\nprepared according to the manufacturer#s protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma\npart#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm\nand emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting\n#background# (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm\nfluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of\nthe positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive\ncontrol.\n" ;

The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP.  The multiplex\nassay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set\nof six G proteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt., CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion in the assay reported here.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with 0.1% BSA in Buffer (0.01%\nNP-40; 30mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 degrees C. \nBeads are washed in wash buffer (0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT). The different bead sets, acquired from Duke\nScientific, have similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied\nmagnitude of emission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nM). \nPositive Controls, which contains bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are\nlocated in columns 1 and 2 on plate.  Negative Controls, bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube.  Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform.\nFlow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence\nemission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and 665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected via Cyan (Dako).  The\nresulting time-resolved single data file per plate is analyzed by IDLQuery software to determine\nthe compound activity in each well.  Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated\nwith different proteins, and the median fluorescence per bead population is calculated. \nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of the effect by a compound on a particular protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound is the minimum number of beads to be collected from a\nwell.  When less than 25 beads are counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. \nCompounds from missing wells is given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4, and are automatically assigned\na PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0.  In this set of 194,738 compounds, for Rab2 there are only 69\nmissing compounds.\n" ;

Compounds tested in this assay were inactive in a set of experiments entitled,\n\"Fluorescence-based counterscreen for orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonists: cell-based high\nthroughput assay for antagonists of the parental CHO cell line, in triplicate\" (AID 492965).\nIn this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX1R receptor (CHO/OX1R cell line) are\ntreated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the\nFluo-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R\nantagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the\nindicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a\n10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 49.8 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative\nhumidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10%\nv/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 739 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X\nantibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).\nThe day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well\nmicrotiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of\nthe fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37\nC, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the\nappropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room\ntemperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470 - 495 nm excitation and 515 -\n575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A\nagonist in DMSO (EC Challenge), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real\ntime fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay.\nA ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following\nmathematical expression:\nRatio = I_Max / I_Min\nWhere:\nI_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read.\nI_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was\nadded.\nPercent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:\n%_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge.\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.8 uM) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.8 uM.\nPubChem Activity Outcome and Score:\nCompounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to\nor less than 10 uM were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-80, and for inactive compounds 79-0.\nList of Reagents:\nCHO/OX1R cells (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, part 36316)\nTrypan red plus (ABD Bioquest, part 2456)\nHam's F-12 media (Invitrogen, part 11765-054)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\nTrypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, part 25200-056)\nFetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen, part 16140-071)\n100X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin mix (Invitrogen, part 15640-055)\nT-175 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, part 159910)\nAgonist: Orexin A peptide (Tocris, part 1455)\nAntagonist: SB-334867-A (Tocris, part 1960)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "qHTS Assay for Inhibitors Targeting the Menin-MLL Interaction in MLL Related Leukemias\n\nTranslocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias\naffecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in\ngeneration of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development.\nPatients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to\navailable therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of\nMLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that\nassociation with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins.\nSelective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach\nto develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL\ninteraction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. \nWe have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of\nMenin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present\nassay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide\nconsists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another\npeptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent\nscreen for inhibitors. \nThe Menin protein, the MLL-wild type (w.t.) derived peptide (N-terminal 12 amino acids), the\nMLL-derived peptide labeled with Texas Red and the MLL-w.t. peptide labeled with Fluorescein were\nkindly supplied by laboratory of Dr. Jolanta Grembecka, University of Virginia. All protein and\npeptide solutions were stored in single use aliquots at -80C. The Eu3+ Cyrptate-conjugated mouse\nmonoclonal antibody anti-6 Histidine  (Eu3+-AB) and  the Streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (XL665) were\npurchased from Cisbio International (Bedford, MA). All antibody and XL665 conjugate solution stocks\nwere stored in single use aliquots at -20C. The Buffer components for all assays were purchased\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).\nFP Assay Reagents:\n1.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a\nhigh-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1. The assay was performed in a \"duplex\"\nformat in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL)\ncell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a\nred-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells\nduring flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the\npeptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with\nhigh affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were\ndetermined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the\nduplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.\n\nThis assay was previously used in a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign with 24,306 compounds\nto identify 181 with FPR binding activity (AID 440) and an additional 72 with FPRL1 binding\nactivity (AID 441). The primary HTS assay was performed in 384-well format at a compound\nconcentration of 6.7 microM. In the present study, the 252 compounds that satisfied hit selection\ncriteria in the two primary HTS assays (> 30% inhibition of fluorescent ligand binding) were tested\nin a dose response format to confirm activity and determine potency. The compounds were hit-picked\nat a 10 milliM concentration in DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine\ndifferent test compound concentrations.\n\nThe FPR dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported\nseparately (AID 519) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and\nspecificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPRL1\nbinding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity\nand specificity of compounds identified to have FPR binding activity in the FPR dose-response assay\nreport (AID 520).\n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL\neach, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\n\nThe fluorescent Wpep ligand had a Kd of 8 nanoM for FPRL1 and was used at a final concentration of\n5 nanoM.\n\nKi determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in\nthe dose response assay.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma\nbinding protein 9 (RBBP9)\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as inhibitors of RBBP9. In this assay,\na fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase\nfamily is used to label RBBP9 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with\nlinear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value\n(mP). As designed, test compounds that act as RBBP9 inhibitors will prevent RBBP9-probe\ninteractions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well,\nleading to low fluorescence polarization in the well. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a\nfinal nominal concentration of 7.94 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 4.0 ul of Assay Buffer (0.1% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM\nNaCl, pH 8.0) containing 2.5 uM of RBBP9 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next,\n40 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.794% final concentration) were added to the\nappropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 1.0 ul of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells.\nPlates were centrifuged and after 45 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence\npolarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY\nTMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence\npolarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The\nwell fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\nPercent inhibition = (Test_Compound_mP -median_Positive_Control_mP) / (median_Negative_Control_mP -\nmedian_Positive_Control_mP)*100\nWhere:\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing RBBP9 and DMSO,\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing RBBP9 in the presence of test compound,\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing no RBBP9 protein.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and\n(2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff\nparameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was\ndeclared active.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 6 and active compounds range\nof activity score is 6 to 100.\nThe reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition.\nNegative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nList of Reagents:\nRecombinant RBBP9 (supplied by Assay Provider)\nFP-Rh probe (supplied by Assay Provider)\nTris HCl (Sigma, part T3038)\nNaCl (Sigma, part S6546)\nPluronic acid (Invitrogen, part P6866)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789176)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulation of the differentiation and activity of inflammatory cells through cytokine signaling is\nessential for proper immune function and to prevent auto-immune disease and leukemias (1, 2). The\nprotein tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is critical for this process (3-6). Following\nactivation of cytokine receptors, particularly erythropoietin and interferon receptors, JAK2\nphosphorylates transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription\n(STAT) family, leading to expression of target genes involved in immune cell homeostasis (2, 3).\nThe discovery of acquired genetic mutations in the JAK2 gene in hematopoetic cells from patients\nwith Myeloid Proliferative Disorders (MPDs) characterized by excess proliferation of differentiated\nbone marrow myeloid cells (7-10), provided insights into the role of JAK2 in hematopoiesis. The\nidentified JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F) replaces guanine with thymine, resulting in a valine to\nphenylalanine amino acid substitution at codon 617 within the pseudokinase JH2 autoinhibitory\ndomain (7-10). The resulting JAK2V617F variant is constitutively active, mediating JAK-STAT\nsignaling efficiently even in the absence of ligand. Thus, the discovery of small molecules that\ncan differentially inhibit JAK2V617F and not wildtype JAK2 may provide insights into JAK2 signaling\nin hematopoiesis and MPD pathogenesis (11, 12).\n\nFollowing the screening campaign (AIDs 1446, 1486, 1520, 1521, 1691, and 1699), certain compounds\nwere identified as possible candidates for probe development. Compounds of interest were reordered\nas powders, and analogs were purchased or synthesized and tested in assays to determine potency\n(Assay 1), cytotoxicity (Assay 2), and selectivity (Assays 3-4). The probe development effort based\non the hits from the HTS screening campaign resulted in no improvement over the prior art. No\nprobes were identified and the SRIMSC probe development effort for this project has now stopped.\nDetails of protocols, compound structures, and results from the original assays can be found in\nPubChem at the respective AIDs listed below.\n\nJAK2V617F Inhibition Assay (Assay 1):\nThe purpose of these assays is to determine whether purchased or synthesized analogs of the\noriginal HTS hits act as inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617 kinase. This assay employs the same\nprotocol as AID 1691. This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses\nEpoR and JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is\ncytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent,\nwhich contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light\nin the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell\nviability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well\nluminescence. Compounds were tested in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a maximum\nnominal concentration of 40 micromolar.\nBa/F3 Cell Line Cytotoxicity Counterscreen Assay (Assay 2):\nThe purpose of these assays is to determine whether compounds of interest were nonselective\ninhibitors due to cytotoxicity of the parental Ba/F3 cell line. This assay employs the same\nprotocol as AID 1699. In this assay, murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell viability is measured using the\nCellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle\nluciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit\ncell viability will lead to decreased ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and\nwell luminescence. Compounds were tested in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a maximum\nnominal concentration of 40 micromolar.\nirf1 Inhibition Assay (Assay 3):\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit endogenous JAK2V617F activity. This\nassay employs CellSensor irf1-bla human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells which stably express a\nbeta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the STAT5 response element from the interferon\nregulatory factor-1 (irf1) gene promoter (Invitrogen). HEL cells are growth factor independent and\ncontain an endogenous homozygous JAK2V617F mutation which leads to constitutive STAT5 activity. Due\nto the constitutive STAT5 activity in these cells, irf1-bla HEL cells constitutively express\nbeta-lactamase. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of the\nLiveBLAzer FRET B/G substrate and measurement of the ratio of fluorescence at 447 nM and 520 nM. As\ndesigned, compounds that inhibit endogenous JAK2V617 activity will reduce irf1 promoter activity,\nleading to reduced beta-lactamase production and substrate cleavage, thereby decreasing the 447/520\nratio. The dose response assay was run in triplicate in a 10-point dose-response series starting at\na nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. \nirf1 Inhibition Counterscreen Assay (Assay 4):\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify nonselective active compounds from the previous screen.\nThis assay employs CellSensor irf1-bla mouse pro B (Ba/F3) cells which stably express a\nbeta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the STAT5 Response Element present in the interferon\nregulatory factor-1 (irf1) gene promoter (Invitrogen). Ba/F3 cells are growth dependent on IL-3 and\nhave an intact IL-3#JAK2#STAT5 pathway. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds,\nfollowed by addition of the LiveBLAzer FRET B/G substrate and measurement of the ratio of\nfluorescence at 447 nM and 520 nM. As designed, compounds that inhibit the IL-3#JAK2#STAT5 pathway\nwill lead to reduced beta-lactamase production and substrate cleavage, thereby decreasing the\n447/520 ratio.

This\nparticular assay uses the kidney mesenchymal cell line which is derived from normal human renal\nglomeruli.\n\nThe CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure the\nnumber of viable cells in culture. The end point readout of this assay is based on quantitation of\nintracellular ATP, an indicator of metabolic activity, using the luciferase reaction. Luciferase\ncatalyzes the oxidation of beetle Luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. The\nluminescent signal is proportional to amount of ATP present.\nUsing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, the amount of cellular ATP was measured\nin the kidney mesenchymal cell line with complete culture medium following compound treatment for\n40 hours. The assay was performed in opaque white Kalypsys 1536-well plates. In the screen,\ntamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as positive controls. Library compounds were measured for their\nability to cause acute toxicity in the cell line, as reflected by a decrease in intracellular ATP\nlevels, in a concentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal\nactivity (DMSO only) and 100% inhibition (100 uM tamoxifen).

        bat:hasParagraph  "The modulation of immune response activity is one of the major goals in the development of novel\ntherapeutics for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. The innate system resides at the\nintersection of the pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, and cell death, thereby\noffering various therapeutic targets. In this context, NOD1 and NOD2 are of particular interest,\nsince they recognize distinct structures derived from bacterial peptidoglycans and directly\nactivate NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nThe NOD proteins participate in the signaling events triggered by host recognition of specific\nmotifs (mostly, muropeptides) in bacterial peptidoglycan (PG). Upon activation, NODs induce\nactivation of NF-kB, a central regulator of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. NOD2 is a\ngeneral bacterial sensor that participates in the innate immunity against Gram-positive bacteria\n(S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium) and mycobacteria (M.\ntuberculosis), while NOD1 recognizes mainly Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Chlamydia, H. pylori).\n Prior studies have shown the muramyldipeptide (MDP), a PG component, stimulates NOD2 activation in\ncells, while Ala-gamma Glu-diaminopimelic acid (GM-tri-DAP) stimulates NOD1, thus providing\nconvenient, synthetic ligands for activating the proteins in intact cells.\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important mediator of the immune reaction and a major chemokine involved\nin inflammatory responses. Apart of being a prototypical NF-kappaB target gene, recent studies have\nindicated that Gamma-tri-DAP induction of human breast cancer epithelial cell lines MCF-7\nover-expressing NOD1, combined with small doses of cycloheximide (CHX), specifically induces IL-8\nsecretion (da Silva Correia, 2006; da Silva Correia 2007).\nThe assay described below uses tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a canonical NF-kB inducer,\nand is designed for identification of hits specific to TNFa-modulated pathways. We utilized this\nassay to assess selectivity of hits emerging from  the  NOD1- specific assay, \"SAR analysis of\nGM-Tri-DAP induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD1 cells\" (AID 2250) and NOD2- specific assay, \"SAR\nanalysis of Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induced IL-8 production in MCF-7/NOD2 cells\"(AID 2260) using\nIL-8.\n\nProtocol:  \n1. MCF7 cells stably overexpressing NOD1\n2. TNF-alpha (Sigma)\n3. IL-8 OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)\n4. SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices)\nProtocol:\n1. Compounds were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep (culture medium), and 10 uL were added\ninto respective wells  (96-well culture plate) to reach desired final concentrations.\n2. TNF-alpha was added, in a final concentration of 5.4 ng/ml, to a culture medium suspension of\nMCF-7 cells (3,6x10+5 cells per mililiter).\n3. Pre-induced MCF-7 cells were added into the respective wells (140 ul per well) and kept at 37oC\n(5% CO2 incubator) for 24 hours.\n4. Thirty microliters of culture medium was used to measure IL-8 production using an IL-8 ELISA kit\nfrom BD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences)\nwere coated with 100 uL per well of Capture Antibody diluted in Coating Buffer (100 mM Sodium\ncarbonate, pH9.5) for overnight at 4oC. The wells were washed 3 times with 200 uL Washing Buffer\n(PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) and then blocked by 200 uL Assay Diluent (PBS with 10 % FBS) at room\ntemperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times and 30 uL sample and proper amount of\nstandards were added. The plate was sealed and incubated at 4oC overnight. After 5 total washes,\n100 uL of Working Detector (detection antibody + SAv-HRP reagent) was added. The plate was then\nsealed and incubated for 1 h. After 7 total washes, 100 uL Substrate Solution was added and the\nplate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 50 uL Stop Solution was added and\nabsorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a spectrometer SpectraMax 190 (Molecular\nDevices). Absorbance at 570nm was subtracted from those of 450nm and data was analyzed.\n5. Absorbance values were converted to IL-8 amounts (measured as pg/ml) according to standard curve\nanalysis.\n" ;

Several lines of experimental evidence confirm that\nHK activity is essential to T. brucei.  First, RNA interference (RNAi) of HK in BSF parasites is\nlethal.  Also, attempts to generate knockouts have been\nunsuccessful.  Last, specific inhibitors of TbHK activity have\nbeen developed that are trypanocidal, albeit at high concentrations. \nT. brucei expresses two nearly identical HKs, TbHK1 and 2, from genes found in tandem on chromosome\n10.  Interestingly, the polypeptides are 98% identical.  TbHK1 and 2 are distinct from mammalian\nHKs, however, sharing only 30-33% sequence identity.  The biochemical differences between TbHKs and\nhuman HK suggest that TbHKs could be therapeutic targets.  Indeed, it has been suggested that the\npossibility of developing specific inhibitors for TbHKs is far from remote (Opperdoes and Michels,\n2001), and now our ability to generate active recombinant protein makes identifying long\nsought-after inhibitors a possibility. \n \nThus, a simple \"mix and read\" absorption-based assay was adapted to HTS format by the University of\nPittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center (PMLSC, a part of the Molecular Library Screening\nCenter Network (MLSCN)) and was used to screen the MLSCN compound library for inhibitors of the\nenzyme.  \nBasic High Throughput Screening Assay protocol\nThe basic procedure for the TbHK1 HTS assay follows a stepwise addition of reaction mixture\ncomponents as follows: \n1     15 uL of a 30 uM concentration of test compound is added to appropriate wells (final compound\nconcentration 10 uM). \n2     15 uL of a glucose + ATP + MgCl2 + NAD+ + G6PDH mixture is added with final concentrations of\n0.5mM, 0.35mM, 1.5mM, 3mM, and 0.006mUnits/uL, respectively.\n3     15 uL of TbHK1 enzyme is added per well (final 0.5ng/uL).\n4     Reaction incubates for 2 hours at room temperature. \n5     5 uL EDTA is added (final 50mM). \n6     Data was captured at A340 and represents the increase in NADH  \n      in the reaction mixture. \n" ;

The selective 5HT1a agonist,\n5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was also added (50nL) to positive control wells to a final\nconcentration of 1.25 micromolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 100% activity (EC100).\nPlates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well\nof the fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1096), prepared according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2\nhours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer\nLifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535\nnm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting \"background\" (i.e. wells\ncontaining media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was\ncalculated. \n\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is\nobserved. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no\nexact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The concept of biased agonism [1] is an emerging concept of molecular pharmacology which proposes\nthat seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), exist in\nmultiple signaling conformations and complexes and that ligands (either agonists or antagonists)\ncan induce signaling biased responses for distinct signal transduction cascades. \nRecently, this concept has been highlighted by beta-arrestin-biased signaling through 7TMRs [1].\nbeta-arrestins have been known to interact with agonist-occupied 7TMRs and thus to sterically\ninhibit coupling of the receptor to G proteins, leading to termination of signaling. Furthermore,\naccumulating evidence over the last decade has drawn attention to a novel function of\nbeta-arrestins as signal transducers that scaffold various signaling molecules upon activation of\n7TMRs. In particular, beta-arrestins have been shown to mediate activation of several signaling\npathways upon stimulation of 7TM receptors even in the absence of G protein activation [2]. This\nbeta-arrestin-biased signaling presumably leads to distinct physiological outcomes from those by G\nprotein activation. \nAdditionally, the active receptor conformations which prefer on this beta-arrestin signaling are\nlikely different from those activating G protein signaling \nOne of the systems in which biased agonism has been thoroughly elucidated is beta2-adrenergic\nreceptors (beta2-ARs), where the 'antagonist' ligand carvedilol has been demonstrated to\nselectively activate beta-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways [3]. \nThe goal of this screening project will be to discover and optimize novel beta-arrestin-biased\nligands for beta2-AR signaling. A luminescent cell-based assay for beta2-AR-mediated agonism, known\nas the Tango assay [4], has been validated in which ligand binding of a recombinant beta2-AR and\nsubsequent recruitment of a recombinant beta-arrestin lead to the release of the transcriptional\nactivator tTA, which upregulates transcription of a tTA-responsive luciferase gene. Compounds with\nbeta2-AR agonist activity lead to an increase in luciferase expression, and upon addition of a\nluciferase detection reagent, demonstrate an increase in luminescence. Compounds were screened as a\nconcentration-titration series that ranged from 46 microM to 0.6 nM.\n\nTango cells were dispensed into white, solid, tissue-culture-treated 1536-well plates at 1500\ncells/well in DMEM, containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then, 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were\ndelivered to each well using a pin tool. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 for 18 hr.\nThen 2.5 uL luminescent substrate mix (in-house prepared: 150 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, 1%\nTriton X-100, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM CoA, 0.15 mM ATP, 0.44 mM D-luciferin, final concentrations) was\nadded to each well. Plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and subsequently\nmeasured on a ViewLux plate reader for luminescent signal using a clear filter with a 10 second\nexposure and 2x binning. The %Activity was determined from the corrected luminescence values.\nIsoproterenol, a well-characterized beta2-AR full agonist, and metaproterenol, a less potent\nbeta2-AR agonist, were included both in 16-pt titration and at full response concentration to\nnormalize %Activity of identified agonists; DMSO-pinned controls were used to normalize 0%Activity\n(zero agonism), while EC100 isoproterenol and/or EC100 metaproterenol were used to normalize\n100%Activity (full agonism). \nConcentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the resulting luminescence.\nThe concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response\nmagnitude and degree of measured activity, and compounds were subsequently categorized based on\ntheir curve class. Active agonists showed concentration-dependent increases in luminescence,\nconcordant with an increase in bound beta2-AR and luciferase expression. Inactive compounds showed\nno effect on luminescence signal.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for drug discovery. The regulator of\nG-protein signaling (RGS)-protein family has important roles in GPCR signal transduction. RGS\nproteins contain a conserved RGS-box, which is often accompanied by other signaling regulatory\nelements. RGS proteins accelerate the deactivation of G proteins to reduce GPCR signaling; however,\nsome also have an effector function and transmit signals. Combining GPCR agonists with RGS\ninhibitors should potentiate responses, and could markedly increase the agonist's regional\nspecificity.  The diversity of RGS proteins with highly localized and dynamically regulated\ndistributions in brain makes them attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system\ndisorders. Inhibitors of the RGS:GPCR interaction should prove useful as small molecule tools in\nthis research field. A complex of Gai1 and fluorescently labeled G-alpha-binding peptide (the\n\"GoLoco motif\") derived from RGS12 is incubated with library members. Inhibitors of the binding are\ndetected by a decrease in the fluorescence polarization (FP) of the fluorophore. \n\nAssay Buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM GDP (prepared fresh), and 0.05% NP40 at pH 7.5.\nControls: 10 nM FITC labeled peptide dispensed into columns 3 and 4 to generate negative control\n(full inhibition of binding, -100 % activity).\n\nFour uL of reagents were dispensed to 1536-well Greiner black solid-bottom plates.

SID 17450324\nwas identified in earlier assays, 1266, 1269, 1270, 1287 and 1368 as a possible candidate to\nselectively inhibit NF-kB activation.\nDifferent from antigen receptor induced NF-kB pathway, DNA damage induced NF-kB activation required\nPIDD (p53-induced protein with death domain) which forms a complex with the kinase RIP1 and a\ncomponent of the NF-kB-activating kinase complex, NEMO, in response genotoxic stress.\nWe used doxorubincin to induce DNA damage and then activate NF-kB.\nReference\nJanssens, A.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Thyroid receptor (TR) regulates many homeostatic processes including basal metabolism,\ncardiovascular function, body weight, and lipid trafficking. TR modulators are potential\ntherapeutics for obesity and hyperlipidemias but current thyroid analogs have undesirable side\neffects, particularly cardiac stimulation. To identify inhibitors that specifically prevent the\ninteraction of TR with the steroid receptor coregulator 2 (SRC2), a fluorescence polarization assay\nwas screened. This assay detects interaction of the ligand-binding domain of human TRb with a Texas\nRed labeled SRC2 peptide, corresponding to a 20 amino acid region of the nuclear receptor\ninteraction domain. Small molecule inhibitors that block the interaction of\nTR and SRC2 are detected by a decrease in fluorescence polarization. \n\nFor screening, 5 uL/well 0.6 uM TRb and 20 nM SRC2 Texas Red in protein buffer (20mM Tris\nhydrochloride, 100mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40, 1mM DTT, 1uM T3 and 5% DMSO) was\ndispensed into black solid 1536-well plates (Grenier) using a solenoid-based dispenser. Following\ntransfer of 23 nL compound or DMSO vehicle by a pin tool, the plates were centrifuged 15 s at 1000\nRPM and incubated 5 hr at ambient temperature. The plates were read by an Envision (Perkin Elmer)\nto detect fluorescence polarization of SRC2 Texas Red (555 nm excitation and 632 nm emission). Data\nwere normalized to unbound (all components except TRb) and bound SRC2 Texas Red controls. In this\nassay, we provide % activity data for each concentration as well as potencies for the active\ncompounds.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases\n\nThe objective of the HTS associated with this secondary assay was to identify small molecule\nregulators of Ras and Ras-related GTPases (see Summary Report and PubChem AIDs 757, 758, 759, 760,\n761, 764). The primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to\nmultiplexed, high-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened\nagainst the MLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases\nincluding wildtype and activated mutants exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP.\nThe assay involves the binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A\nset of six G proteins (Rac1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac1 activated, Ras wt, Rab2 wt, CDC wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion.\nIn the assay described here, real-time binding kinetics between GTP and each of the protein targets\nwere characterized in a multiplex assay.  The resulting binding of\nfluorescent GTP after 3 minutes was utilized in determining Bmax and Kd for each target in the\npresence of 10 microM small molecule activator compound MLS000088004 versus a DMSO control.\nEach protein target (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4 degrees C. Protein on\nGSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 milliM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min\nat 30 degrees C, washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then resuspending in the\nsame buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA.  Kinetic assays were performed by\nincubating 50 microliter of GST-target protein-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or\n10 microM MLS000088004 and subsequently adding 50 microL of various concentration ice cold\nBODIPY-GTP.  Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer\nin the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLQuery.\nMeasured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding are converted to molecular\nequivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the\nfollowing equation;\nkMESF = Slope * MCF + Intercept\nwhere MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are\nkiloMESF (1000 * MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5\ndifferent levels of calibration beads.\nThe resulting values of kMESF are graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in\nGraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation;\nkMESF = Bmax * ConcBODIPY-GTP / (Kd + ConcBODIPY-GTP)\nwhere ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP\nper bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4\n(S1P4).\n\nPandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune\ncell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a\nbioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial\nintegrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related\nhigh affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the\nlungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes,\nresulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus\ninfection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is\nhighly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways\ncould be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is\ncoupled to G#i and G#o G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8),\nindicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4\nbiological function.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as antagonists of S1P4. This assay uses\nTango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4)\nlinked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a\nbeta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the\ncontrol of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of\nthe fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The\nliberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA\nexpression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable,\nfluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists\nwill inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of\nGAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in\nsinglicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to\nsample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P\nprepared in 2% BSA (0.3 uM final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells.\nPlates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 ul/well of\nthe LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and\ncontaining 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room\ntemperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences,\nTurku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535\nnm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting #background# for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary\nscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test\ncompound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used\nas a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than\nthat particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.\nThe inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 25 and active compounds\nrange of activity score is 25 to 100.\nThe reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary\ninhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.\nList of Reagents:\nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036)\nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789072)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

Since the\npositive control agonist, GW1929, exhibited time resolved-fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET)\nactivity only after several hours of incubation with the SRC-1/PPARgamma complex, a sample well\nthat exhibited TR-FRET activity immediately after initiation of the SRC-1/PPARgamma assay most\nlikely was the result of format-specific artefact. Therefore, this assay's specific purpose is to\nidentify sample wells that possess this artefact, thus indicating that compounds in those wells may\nhave an erroneous activity assignment in AID 631.\nThis assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion\nprotein and a FLAG-tagged SRC1 coactivator.  The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized\nby fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG\nAllophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  A high ratio in a sample well measured immediately\nafter addition of compound suggests TR-FRET assay format artefact.\nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium\nFluoride, 100 mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered\nat 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining\n46 columns were filled with five ul of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 106 ng/mL anti-GST\nEuK, 2 ug/mL anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC1\nprotein [aa 627-786].  Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g.  The assay was\nstarted by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 uM \nfinal nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. \nImmediately after centrifugation fluorescence was measured by exciting at 340 nm, and reading\nfluorescence emission at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin\nElmer).  Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well,\naccording to the following mathematical expression:\nRatio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000\nWhere,\nI671 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617 nm represents the measured\nfluorescence emission at 617 nm.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally fluorescent compounds.\nTwo values were calculated: (1) the average Ratio of all compounds tested, and (2) three times\ntheir standard deviation.  The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter.  Any\ncompound that exhibited greater fluorescence than the cutoff parameter was flagged as a possible\nTR-FRET artefact. \nList of Reagents:\nPotassium Fluoride (Sigma, part449148-25G)\nCHAPS (Sigma, part C5070-5G)\nSodium Phosphate (Fluka Biochemika, part 71505)\nBovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, part A3294-10G)\nAnti-GST EuK (CisBio, part 61GSTKLB)\nAnti-FLAG APC (SureLight APC, PerkinElmer, part AD0059F)\nGST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] (ProteinOne, part P4036)\nFLAG-tagged SRC1 protein [aa 627-786] (ProteinOne, part P1095).\nReference agonist GW1929 (Sigma, part G5568)\nBlack solid-bottom polystyrene 1536-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, part K1536SBSN)\n" ;

This homogenous\nassay has been miniaturized and optimized for ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) in a 1536-well\nformat.  HexaHis-tagged 14-3-3 zeta protein is indirectly labeled with a europium chelate through a\neuropium conjugated anti-6xHis antibody. Bad peptide phosphorylated at S136 was directly labeled\nwith Dy647.  Europium and Dy647 comprise a fluorescence energy transfer pair. Interaction of 14-3-3\nzeta protein and pS136-Bad peptide brings the two fluorophores into proximity, leading to an energy\ntransfer from europium to Dy647 and the generation of FRET signal. The FRET signal is detected in\nan Envision plate reader (Ex 340 nM, Em 615 nM, and Em665 nM) and expressed as FRET signal ratio\n(F665nm / F615nm * 104).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Species of Leishmania are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases throughout the tropics and\nsubtropics, ranging from self-healing ulcers to highly disfiguring lesions and serious, often\nlethal visceral diseases, such as kala-azar. In Leishmania spp. it has been shown that both sugar\nuptake and gluconeogenesis are necessary to synthesize sufficient hexose-phosphate required for the\nproduction of glycoconjugates and the intracellular polysaccharide mannan which are essential for\nboth replication and virulence of the parasites. Therefore, most of the enzymes participating in\nglycolysis and gluconeogenesis are expected to be essential. The assay\ndescribed here targets pyruvate kinase from Leishmania mexicania (LmPYK) that was obtained as a\nhighly purified preparation from the University of Edinburgh (E451W mutant was provided).  A 1536\nwell assay protocol was set up and validated by screening the LOPAC library in triplicate as an\neight point concentration-titration series using the qHTS platform developed at the NCGC.\n\nThree uL of substrate mix (final concentrations, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5\nmM PEP, 0.1 mM ADP, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA) was dispensed into white solid medium binding\nGreiner 1536 well plates. 23 nL of compound were delivered by a pin tool and 1 uL of enzyme mix\n(final concentration, 0.2 nM LmPYK, 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 0.05% BSA) was added. Plates were\ncovered with stainless steel gasket-lined lids and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Two uL\nof detection and kinase stop mix (PKLight, Lonza) was added, and luminescence read by a ViewLux\n(Perkin Elmer) at 2 second exposure/plate using 2x binning.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Confirmation cell-based high throughput assay for agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate\nReceptor 4 (S1P4).\n\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 agonism activity of compounds identified as active in\na previous set of experiments entitled, \"Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Agonists of the\nSphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)\" (PubChem AID 1509). This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS\ncells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16\ntranscription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease\nfusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response\nelement.\nStimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and\nthrough proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the\nnucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA\nsubstrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 agonists will activate S1P4 and increase\nwell FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 ul\nof cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95%\nRH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to\nsample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. The S1P High\nControl prepared in 2% fatty-acid free BSA was also added to the appropriate control wells to a\nfinal concentration of 5 uM. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After\nthe incubation, 1 ul/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nwhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: %\nActivation =100* (1-((Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control -\nMedian_High_Control)))\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing 5&#956;M S1P\nAny compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the\nPrimary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100%\nof the highest observed activation value.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence-based biochemical high throughput dose response assay for inhibitors of the\nHepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3).\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active\nin set of previous experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput\nscreening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase\n(NS3)\" (AID 1800) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, \"Fluorescence-based\nconfirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus\nnon-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)\" (AID 1943). In this assay, a ssDNA oligonucleotide\nmolecular beacon substrate, featuring a 5' fluorescent Cy5 moiety and a 3' quencher, is annealed to\na second longer DNA oligonucleotide. Upon strand separation by NS3 helicase and ATP, the beacon\nstrand forms an intramolecular hairpin that brings the tethered fluorophore and quencher molecules\ninto juxtaposition, quenching fluorescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit helicase activity\nat 60 minutes (T60) will prevent hairpin formation and interaction of the Cy5 fluorophore and\nquencher, thus preventing quenching of well fluorescence. A T0 fluorescence measurement is also\nperformed to identify compounds that quench and enhance Cy5 fluorescence. Compounds were tested in\ntriplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 109\nmicromolar. \nProtocol Summary:\nPrior to the start of the assay, 4 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 1.25 mM MgCl2,\n0.1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM Tween20, 6 micrograms/mL BSA) containing 13.89 nM NS3 helicase fragment and\n5.56 nM NS3 substrate were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test\ncompound in DMSO, thioflavine S (110 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final\nconcentration) were added to the appropriate wells.\nThe assay was started by dispensing 1 microliter of 5 mM ATP into all wells. Well fluorescence was\nread after 1 hour of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). Prior to\ninhibition calculations the ratio between RFU values obtained at t0 (RFU_t0) and t60 (RFU_t60),\nnamed Ratio_RFU, was calculated as follows:\nRatio_RFU = RFU_t60/RFU_t0\nThe percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:\nPercent inhibition = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / (\npositive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) * 100\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound.\nNegative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.\nPositive_Control is defined as wells containing Thioflavine S.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by  solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 109 micromolar) did\nnot result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50/ was determined manually as greater than 109\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity\nscore of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was\nassigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with\nthe most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe activity score range for active compounds is 100-82, for inactive 79-0.\nList of Reagents:\nNS3 helicase fragment (supplied by Assay Provider)\nCy5/quencher-labeled molecular beacon (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc, custom synthesized)\nThioflavine S (Sigma-Aldrich, part T1892)\nMOPS (Fisher-Biotech, part BP308-100)\nATP (Fisher-BioReagents, part BP413-25)\nMagnesium Chloride (Fisher-Biotech, part BP214-500)\nAssay Buffer (supplied by Assay Provider)\n1536-well plates (Greiner, part 789173)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are autosomal recessive defects in the synthesis of\nN-linked oligosaccharide chains. CDG group I (CDG-I) defects are defined as those caused by\nmutations in genes encoding enzymes used for the synthesis and transfer of lipid linked\noligosaccharide (LLO) to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER. The steps in this\npathway and the genes encoding them are very similar from yeast to human. It requires 30-40 single\ngene products, each dependent on the previous step in the linear sequence to produce and transfer\nthe LLO to protein. Therefore, mutations in any step may cause a type of CDG. There is considerable\noverlap in the clinical presentations between different types of CDG and a broad diversity within\neach type. The most common form of CDG, called Type Ia (CDG-Ia), is caused by defects in PMM2\n(Man-6-P to Man-1-P), the gene that encodes phosphomannomutase. Mortality is 20% in the first 5\nyrs, but then patients stabilize. Currently, there is no treatment for the CDG-Ia. \nCDG-Ib patients, who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzing conversion of\nMan-6-P to Fru-6-P, are successfully treated with free mannose. Unfortunately, mannose therapy is\nnot effective for CDG-Ia patients, most likely due to efficient Man-6-P consumption in the PMI\nreaction.  It is believed that patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia)\nwill benefit from dietary mannose if there is a simultaneous reduction of phosphomannose isomerase\n(PMI) activity. This would allow a modest intracellular accumulation of Man-6-P and drive metabolic\nflux into the glycosylation pathway using the residual PMM2 activity. It is assumed that a\nnon-competitive inhibitor would work best in this setting.  \nThe purpose of this assay is to identify non-competititve inhibitors of human PMI.  This is\naccomplished by using a G6PD- NADPH-coupled assay.  In the assay PMI activity is detected through\nconversion of its product, fructose-6-phosphate, to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose\nisomerase (PGI) and subsequent oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone\nconcomitant with NADP-to-NADPH conversion catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).\nThe NADPH is then detected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction. \nThis assay is performed in the presence of 10x-Km concentrations of the PMI substrate,\nmannose-6-phosphate, to help to ensure the identification of non-competitive inhibitors. \nThis dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"HTS\nidentification of compounds inhibiting phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) via a fluorescence intensity\nassay using a high concentration of mannose 6-phosphate\" (AID 1220) and to study the\nstructure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired\nfrom commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nPMI assay materials:\n1) Human PMI protein was provided by Dr. Hudson Freeze (Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute,\nSan Diego, CA). \n2) Substrate working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.0 mM Mannose-6-phosphate, 1.6 U/ml\nDiaphorase, 0.2 mM Resazurin.\n3) Enzyme working solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.44 mM NADP+, 9.048 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 4.6\nug/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 30 ng/ml PMI, 1.8 ug/ml G6PDH. \nPMI Dose-response confirmation protocol:\n1) 9 uL of Substrate working solution was added to columns 3-24 of a Greiner 384-well black plate\n(cat # 784076) using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix)\n2) 9 ul of Substrate working solution without mannose-6-p was added to columns 1 and 2 (positive\ncontrol) \n3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial\ndilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final\nDMSO concentration. \n4) 2 uL compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22. Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4\nuL of 10% DMSO.\n5) 9 uL of Enzyme working solution was added to the whole plate using a Thermo Multidrop Combi\ndispenser. \n6) Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. \n7) The plates were read on an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices), Ex544, Em590.\n8) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. \nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. \nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\nAssay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2mM\nFluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume\nof assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and\n2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X stock concentration\n(30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final\nDMSO concentration of 0.3%.  Acetylcholine CRC serial dilutions were prepared at a 10X stock\nsolution in assay buffer prior to addition to assay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at\n25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following\nprotocol.  Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the\naddition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were then stimulated for 50 sec with a one of eight\nconcentrations of the Acetylcholine CRC.  The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and\nthen as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50 values for the Acetylcholine\nCRC alone (i.e. plus Vehicle) and in the presence of a fixed high concentration (30 uM final\nconcentration) of each test compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves\nusing standard non-linear regression (variable slope).\nThis compound shifted the EC50 of acetylcholine in the calcium flux assay by greater than 13 fold.\nThe compound was assigned 'Outcome' as 'Active' and 'Score' as '100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Of the current available drugs against influenza A virus, two target the M2 proton channel [1].\nThese are the adamantane-based compounds Amantadine and its close analogue Rimantadine. The M2\nprotein includes a 24-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a 19-residue hydrophobic\ntransmembrane domain, and a 54-residue cytoplasmic tail. A number of biophysical and computational\nstudies strongly suggest that M2 forms a homotetrameric transmembrane alpha-helical bundle that\nacts as a proton channel. Here, the channel s activated at lower values (pH  6.2) and it is closed\nat physiological pH. This function has been attributed to the H37 residue located in the channel\npore. As anticipated above, this pH regulation by the M2 proton channel is fundamental to the virus\nlife cycle. Following virus endocytosis and endosome the M2 activation induces acidification that\nweakens the bonds between the viral RNA and the virus capsid stimulating its release. Conversely,\nduring virus exit, the M2 channel prevents acidification of the exosome which would cause premature\nand irreversible conformational changes of the viral hemagglutinin. Hence, the development of\nmolecules capable of blocking the M2 channel represent an effective and attractive strategy for\nanti-influenza drugs. However, the use of currently available drugs against the M2 receptors,\nAmantadine (1-aminoadamantane) and Rimantadine rather limited since the 1960s, due to several side\neffects, due to the inhibition of the human NMDA receptor, and the appearance of\namantadine-resistant viral strains that contain single amino acid substitutions in the M2 protein.\nTwo of the most recurring mutations that conferred amantadine resistance are localized to the\ntransmembrane domain of the protein, the site of binding of amantadine, are S31N and V27A. The\nfirst has been shown to reduce the size of the pore thereby preventing the binding of Amantadine.\nThe second has been shown to weaken the binding of Amantadine by reducing the interaction interface\nbetween the drug and the interior of the pore. The scope of this project was to screen for small\nmolecules capable of binding to the M2 V27A proton channel in an in vitro binding assay with a\nreconstituted channel in lipids and to subsequently verify that this binding results in inhibition\nof viral replication. Unfortunately, no viable hits were identified\n\n1. Sample preparation\nThe TM domain (22-46) of influenza A virus M2 ion channel was synthesized by Anaspec with purity\n>95%. The peptide was dissolved in DPC (at a peptide/DPC concentration ratio of 1:100). The final\ntest samples were dilute with 100mM phosphate buffer (%95/5% H2O/D2O, pH 8.15) to obtain 25 uM of\nthe tetrameric M2 channel. The sequence of the peptide used was 22-SSDPLAVAASIIGILHLILWILDRL -46\n(MW 2700), hence including the V27A mutation that is amantadine resistant. \n2. Compound Library Screened by NMR\nWe have assembled a scaffold library composed of ~ 4,000 compounds. The compounds have been\nselected based on their anticipated use as building blocks or scaffolds components of further\noptimized molecules. The scaffold library has been acquired from three different sources and the\nchemical structures of the library have been deposited into PubChem. In line with the general NIH\nMolecular Libraries Screening Centers Network (MLSCN) library, we have also included a collection\nof 602 Natural Products (MicroSource) that could be screened by NMR\n3. NMR Based Screening description\nA. Ligand binding was monitored by comparing side chain amino proton peak of the tryptophan residue\n(~10.5ppm) of a 25 uM M2 channel solution (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8.15 containing\n95%/5% H2O/D2O; T= 300 K) in the presence and in absence of compounds tested at a final\nconcentration of 1000 uM. Compounds were initially tested at mixtures of 20, and then individual\ncompounds for those mixtures that caused significant perturbations of the tryptophan peak were\nfurther deconvoluted.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of\nneuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs\nwork via stimulating the D1 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are\nantagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D1 DAR are problematic, however, either\nbeing less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to\nreactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify\nallosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the\npotential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening\napproaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of\nthe D1 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept\nexperiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of\nallosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor\nsignaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will\nattenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound agonism by\ntracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D1 cell line.\nFreshly passaged cells are plated in 1536 well black, clear bottom plates at a density of 4000\ncells/well in 3 ul of complete media containing 1x tetracycline inducer. After an overnight\nincubation at 30 C in 5% CO2, cells are loaded with 2 ul of the no wash Calcium Assay Kit (ABD\nBioquest) and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 90 minutes. A 10 cycle (1 second/cycle)\nbaseline measurement is taken and then the FDSS online 1536 pintool delivers 23 nl of compound\nlibrary (as well as dopamine controls) to the plate. The plate is measured for kinetically at 1\ncycle/sec for 180 seconds and is considered to be the agonist portion of the assay (eg, compounds\nwhich activate a positive calcium response during this portion are flagged as potential agonists).\nFollowing the 180 second read, 1 ul of an EC20 of dopamine is delivered by an onboard pipette head.\nMeasurements are taken kinetically for an additional 180 seconds.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a\nloss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in\nmodulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics\n\nBasic protocol:\n1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/20 ul well 1 day prior to assay in Assay Media\n(DMEM with 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate).\n2. The following day, media is removed from the cells.\n3. 20 ul/well of Fluo-4 AM dye (1 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 2.5mM probenecid) is added.\n4. The plates are incubated for 45 min to one hour at RT.\n5. Dye is removed from the cells.\n6. 20 ul of assay buffer is added and removed. 20 ul of assay buffer is added.\n8. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS.\n9. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20\nul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well,\n50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or\nDMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142\nseconds. The read continues for 300 seconds.\nData analysis:\nData were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a\ngiven trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in\nwhich antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the\nfluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in\nthe baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The max fluorescence increase beginning\nafter the agonist addition was calculated.  Curves were fitted using a four point logistical\nequation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ).\nThis compound was not active as a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR5 and was assigned an\n'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'. Furthermore, the 3-fold decrease in glutamate EC50 in\nthe presence of compound would suggest antagonistic modulation.\n" ;

Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose\ncontribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated.\nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human delta opioid receptor\n(DOR).  This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified\nin \"uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nThis image-based DOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and the delta opioid receptor (DOR). Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the\narrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to\ncoated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the\nGFP-arrestins.\nAssay Materials:\n1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091)\n2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and the DOR1\nreceptor\n3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics\n- 200 ug/ml G418 and 50 ug/ml Zeocin\n4) Positive Control Working Solution: SNC80 (Tocris #0764-10 mg - 5 mM stock in DMSO) diluted in\nwater to 1 uM.  \n5) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO in water\n6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10 mM in 100% DMSO\n7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS.\n8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150 ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10\nmM TRIS, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).\nAssay Procedure:\n1) 45 ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the\nassay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  \n2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2.\n3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45 ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of\ncompounds. \n4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.

When the 5-HT1a receptor is agonized, transcription of\nthe NFAT-BLA gene occurs via a Ga15 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity\nis \nproportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA\nsubstrate. \nThe primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All data reported were normalized on a\nper-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 5-CT at a concentration equal to\nits EC100. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration.\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary\nscreen. \n\nFor all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human 5HT1a\nreceptor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and\nthe G-alpha-15 promiscuous coupling protein was used (Invitrogen, part K1083).\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH.

Stimulation of\nthe CRE pathway by an agonist induces transcription of the BLA gene in proportion to agonist\nconcentration, resulting in increased BLA activity. This increase is monitored by measuring\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA\nsubstrate.\n\nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a\ncyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent\nrelative humidity.  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)\ncontaining 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate,\n25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended\nto a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics,\nand containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. \nPrior to assay 10 ul(100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension were dispensed to each well of 384-well\nassay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by\ndispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to the sample or control\nwells, respectively.   Next, 1.1 ul of forskolin were dispensed to positive control wells (final\nnominal concentration 2 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of PBS was dispensed into negative control wells and\ntest compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. \nAfter the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours\nof incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader\n(PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission\nwavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm.\nPercent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression:\nPercent Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) /\n(median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)]\nWhere:\nWell ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured\nfluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength.\nNegative control wells are defined as wells containing DMSO\nPositive control wells are defined as wells containing 2 uM forskolin\nFor each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a\nfour parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted\ncurves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept.\nIn cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in greater than 50 percent\nactivation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 value was determined manually depending on\nthe observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than\n10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 values less than 10 uM are considered active.\nThe activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value\nwas calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the\npEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent\nactivation is observed. This calculation results in a conservative estimate of the activity score\nfor compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of\nall compounds tested.\nList of reagents:\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part# 11965-092)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (phenol red free) (Invitrogen, part #21063-029)\nBovine Growth Serum (Hyclone, part# SH30541.03) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part# 1114-050)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part# 11360-070)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part# 15630-080)\nL-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part# 25030-081)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part# 10131-027)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen part# 15140-122)\nCharcoal/dextran treated Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, part# SH30068.03)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (JHR, part#85041)\nGeneBLAzer Fluorescent Substrate Mixture (Invitrogen, part #K1085)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part# P8761)\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify small molecule regulators of RGS family protein interactions .\n\nRegulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'Activity'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and\nplay important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems.\nOf these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic\ntargets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of\ncholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs.\nDue to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the\nmAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been\nlargely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been\nimpossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a\nM1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and\nan antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like\nprofile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the\nantipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of\nM1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion\nthat a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide\nantipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by\nrecent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and\ndopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine\nhyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered\nhippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide\na novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1\nmay also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the\nrelative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-\nlike effects of this compound in animal models are not known.  However, highly selective centrally\npenetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine\nthe in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. \nThe purpose of this assay was to test the lead compound for potency against rM4/Gqi5 in a calcium\nmobilization assay.\nAssay Info: CHO-K1 cells stably expressing rat M4 and Gqi5 were loaded with calcium indicator dye\n(2mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate\nvolume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM\nHEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were serially diluted in assay buffer for a final 2X\nstock in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of\n0.3%.  Acetylcholine EC20 was prepared at a 10X stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to\nassay plates.  Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a FLEXstation II (Molecular\nDevices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol.  Cells were preincubated with test\ncompound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the agonist, acetylcholine.  Cells were\nthen stimulated for 50 sec with a submaximal concentration (EC20).  The signal amplitude was first\nnormalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the maximal response to acetylcholine. EC50\nvalues for each compound were determined using GraphPad Prism (4.0c), which fit curves using\nstandard non-linear regression (variable slope). All compounds showed dose-dependency and therefore\nwere assigned 'Outcome' = 'Active' and 'Score' = '100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "With over 30 million people infected worldwide, and an estimated 2.5 million new infections and 2.1\nmillion AIDS-related deaths occurring each year, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a\nsignificant public health and socioeconomic impact throughout the world.  Currently, there is no\nvaccine available to prevent HIV-1 infection, and although numerous antiretroviral drugs have been\napproved by the FDA, development of drug resistance to these drugs remains a significant problem\nfor the treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals.  The fusion of HIV-1 with the cellular membrane\nduring entry of the virus into a cell is an established target for inhibition of HIV-1 infection,\nhowever only one drug (Fuzeon/enfuvirtide/T20) is currently FDA-approved, and no small molecule\ninhibitors of this target are available.  Hence, this program will provide chemical probes from\nwhich to optimize leads for the development of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors.\nThe CCR5 Tropic HIV-1 Fusion Inhibition Assay (PMID 16314403 and 18316528) uses two different cell\nlines to detect HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion.  The first cell line (MAGI-CCR5 cells; (PMID\n9094670); obtained from the NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) has been engineered to\nexpress the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) proteins, and to contain an HIV-1\nLTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct.  The second cell line (HeLa-R5-16; (PMID 16314403);\nobtained as a kind gift from Roche Palo Alto, LLC) has been engineered to express the Envelope\nprotein (Env) from the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolate 92US715, and also to express the Tat\nprotein from HIV-1 NL4 3.  Expression of CCR5-tropic Env in the HeLa-R5-16 cells is induced from\nthe Tet On promoter through treatment with Doxycycline, while Tat is constitutively expressed by\nthe cells.  Co culturing of the two cell lines leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion,\nthereby introducing HIV-1 Tat from the HeLa-R5-16 cells into the MAGI-CCR5 cells, which results in\nTat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct and\nupregulation of beta galactosidase expression.  As a result, beta galactosidase activity, which is\nmeasured as a luminescent signal, serves as a reporter for monitoring HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell\nfusion and its inhibition.  In the absence of an inhibitor, co-cultures of the two cell lines\nexhibit a high basal level of beta galactosidase activity.  Compounds that inhibit HIV-1\nEnv-mediated cell-cell fusion prevent the upregulation of beta galactosidase expression, resulting\nin a low luminescent signal.  This assay identifies compounds that inhibit the viral attachment,\nfusion, and related events associated with HIV-1 entry into a cell.\n\nMaterials: 384-well plate (Corning, catalog number 3712), Beta-Glo Luciferase (Promega),\nDoxycycline hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals), Maraviroc, and DMEM (Cellgro cat. 10-013-CV)\nCell Culture:  The two cell lines used were MAGI-CCR5 cells (engineered to express the HIV-1\nreceptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) proteins, and containing an HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase\nreporter construct) and HeLa-R5-16 cells (engineered to express the Envelope protein from the\nCCR5-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolate 92US715, and the Tat protein from HIV-1 NL4 3). The HeLa R5-16\neffector cells were sub-cultured in DMEM (Cellgro cat. 10-013-CV) with 10% FBS, 100 ug/mL\nPenicillin-Streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamine, 1X NEAA (Non-essential amino acids) and 500 ug/mL G418\n(complete growth medium), while the MAGI-CCR5 target cells were sub-cultured in complete growth\nmedium containing 1 ug/mL Puromycin. The cells were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide,\nand maintained at sub-confluent density for no more than 20 passages.\nCompound Dosing/Plating:  Carrier or Maraviroc diluted in complete growth medium containing 1 ug/mL\nDoxycycline (assay medium) to prepare a 5X concentrated dosing solution (200 nM Maraviroc/5% DMSO)\nwas dispensed into 384-well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates (5 uL volume) with a\nBiomek FX [After cell addition, this should result in a final culture volume in assay plates of 25\nuL, with final concentrations of 40 nM Maraviroc and 1% DMSO]. Test compounds were serially diluted\nin a plate-to-plate matrix or \"stacked plate\" dose response format.  All 320 compounds in a source\nplate were diluted together through the 10-plate matrix resulting in a 10-point dose response\ndilution series. It can be visualized as a serial dilution series proceeding vertically through a\nstack of plates with the high dose plate on top and the low dose plate on the bottom with the final\ncompound concentration ranging from 0.098 to 50 uM and a final DMSO concentration of 1% for all\nconcentrations.\n\nCell Plating:  On ice and while stirring, MAGI CCR5 (500,000 cells/mL) and HeLa-R5-16 (300,000\ncells/mL) cells were mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio and 20 uL of the mixture of the two cell lines\ndispensed to get 5000 MAGI and 3000 HeLa cells per well. Plates were incubated at 37oC in 5% CO2\nfor at least 40 h (40-48 h).\nEndpoint/Detection: At the end of the treatment period, 25 uL of Beta-Glo reagent was added and\nassay plates incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, in the dark. Luminescence (0.1 second\nintegration time) was read on a PerkinElmer EnVision multilabel plate reader.\nData Analysis: Thirty-two control wells containing cells treated with DMSO vehicle and 24 wells\ncontaining Maraviroc were included on each assay plate to calculate Z value for each plate and to\nnormalize the data on a per plate basis. Z values ranged from 0.72 to 0.80 with a mean of 0.76.\nCompound data was normalized and reported as % Inhibition which was calculated using the following\nformula: % Inhibition = 100*(1-(Cmpd Lum-Med pos Ctrl)/(Med Neg Ctrl-Med Pos Ctrl)). The normalized\n% Inhibition was plotted against the tested concentrations of 0.098 to 50 uM. The IC50 values were\ncalculated using XLfit formula 205, a 4 parameter Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm allowing\nextrapolation to identify weakly active compounds.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "The existence of several receptors mediating estrogen response via multiple pathways complicates\nthe investigation of the independent effects of each receptor. In addition to estrogen, a variety\nof steroidal and non-steroidal compounds bind and modulate estrogen receptor activity, often with\nvarying results depending on the receptor in question. For example, antagonists of the classical\nestrogen receptors, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, are commonly used in the clinic to treat\ncancer and osteoperosis; however, these compounds act as agonists of GPR30, complicating treatment\nas well as basic research on the various receptors. To this end, it would\nbe beneficial to identify small molecules with distinct binding activities for each receptor as\nwell as differential functional characteristics. These small molecule probes will be potentially\nuseful not only in the study and characterization of ERalpha, ERbeta and GPR30 but will also have\npossible therapeutic value as specific agonists and antagonists of a single receptor in cancer\ntherapy as well as treatment of other estrogen-mediated pathologies.\n\nTo identify small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on ERalpha, a competitive\nbinding approach using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by\nvirtual screening and derived from the MLSMR as well as other in-house chemical libraries. This\nassay measures the ability of small molecules with unknown ERalpha binding affinity to compete with\nan Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to ERalpha in permeabilized whole cells\nexpressing ERalpha-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist\ncharacteristics of molecules that bind ERalpha will be assessed using various secondary assays.\nThe assay is conducted in 384- well tissue culture plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6\nCos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with\nERalpha-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer#s instructrions).

Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping\nand resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. \nThe assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control, column 23 contains\npositive control (1 microM estrogen), and columns 2 and 24 contain untransfected cells. Columns\n3-22 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in\nligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of\ncells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37\ndegreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM\nNaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH\n6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate\nis incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS\ncontaining 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled\nusing the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward\nscatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while\nE2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). \nPrimary screening was completed at 10 microM as well as 100 nanoM to identify a select number of\nrelatively potent primary hits. \n\nAcquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery\nidentifies 384- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population\nis identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for\nanalysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the\nbasis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and\ndefined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen)\nwells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding.\nSample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control\nwells.\nCompounds were considered \"Active\" if they inhibited more than 65% of binding at either 10 microM\nor 100 nanoM. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for \"Actives\" and 1 for \"Non-Actives.\"\nThe PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding\ncompared with activity cutoff (i.e., 65%). Compounds with percent inhibition below activity cutoff\n(i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to\ncalculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for Active compounds with percent inhibition above activity\ncutoff:\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff)\nwhere Cutoff was 65% and %Inhibition was the maximum %inhibition above the Cutoff between 10 microM\nand 100 nanoM experiments. The %Inhibition was calculated by:\n%Inhibition = 100 (1 - Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF)\nwhere Sample MCF was the Median Channel Fluorescence from sample well and Negative Control MCF was\nthe average over assayed plate of Median Channel Fluorescence from the negative control wells\n(i.e., wells with DMSO vehicle only).\n" ;

Recent studies have shown that opioid\nreceptors play a role in regulating other receptors that interact with drug and other substance\nabuse.  The opioid receptors are composed of multiple of multiple receptor subtypes whose\ncontribution the addictive behaviors are not fully delineated.\nThe aim of this assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the human mu opioid receptor (MOR).\n This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in \"uHTS\nidentification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent\nbeta-arrestin assay\" (AID 1777) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the\nconfirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally.\nThis image-based MOR agonist assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP\nbiosensor and the mu opioid receptor (MOR).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that\nwere purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single\nparticular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated\nagainst different GTPase targets.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

This subtype of leukemia is\nusually associated with chromosome 16 inversion (p13:q22).

Assessment of the agonist or antagonist\ncharacteristics of molecules that bind GPR30 will be assessed using various secondary assays.\nThe assay is conducted in 96-well PCR plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells\n(ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with GPR30-GFP using\nLipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructions).

        bat:hasParagraph  "Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine\n1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized analogues.\n\nPandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune\ncell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a\nbioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial\nintegrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related\nhigh affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the\nlungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes,\nresulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus\ninfection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is\nhighly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways\ncould be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is\ncoupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8),\nindicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4\nbiological function.\n\nThe purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonist dose response of synthesized compounds.\nThis assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene\n6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also\nexpress a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under\nthe control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration\nof the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor.\nThe liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene.\nBLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a\ncleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4\nantagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing\nproteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were\ntested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of\n50 micromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nU2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The\ngrowth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum,\n0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin,\n200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  \nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay\nMedium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10\nmicroliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5%\nCO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO\nalone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.22\nmicromolar final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then\nincubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 microliter/well of the\nLiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing\n10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the\ndark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at\nan excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. \nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm / I535 nm \nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds\nwith an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active.\nAny compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an\nactivity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration\nwas assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency,\nwith the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.\nThe PubChem activity score for active compounds is 100-1, there are no inactives.\nList of Reagents: \nTango EDG6-bla U2OS cells (Invitrogen, part K1622)\nGeneBLAzer FRET B/G Loading Kit (CCF4-AM) (Invitrogen, part K1025)\nProbenecid (Sigma, part P8761)\nFreestyle Expression Medium (Assay media; Invitrogen, part 12338-018)\nMcCoy's 5A Medium (modified) (1X) (Invitrogen, 16600-082)\nFetal Bovine Serum, dialyzed (Invitrogen, part 26400-036) \nNEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mix (Invitrogen, part 15140-122)\nSodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070)\nPBS without calcium or magnesium (Invitrogen, part 14190-136)\nHEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080)\nTrypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, part 25300-054)\nS1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, part 860492P)\nFatty Acid Free BSA (Calbiochem, part NC9734015)\nZeocin (Invitrogen, part R250-01)\nHygromycin (Invitrogen, part 10687-010)\nGeneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027)\n384-well plates (Greiner, part 788092)\nT175 tissue culture flasks (Corning, part 431080)\n" ;

Unfortunately, traditional therapies for\ntreatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are\nassociated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a\ndetailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic,\napproaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients. Exciting advances suggest that\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play\nimportant roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD\ntherapeutics.\n\nBasic protocol:\n1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well 1 day prior to assay in Thallium Assay Media\n(DMEM + 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate).\n2.

Dye is removed from the cells and the cell are washed with Assay Buffer leaving 20uL residual\nvolume.\n6. Plates are incubated for 10 minutes at RT.\n7. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS.\n8. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20\nul added per well) and the agonist (glutamate) is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist\nadded per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition\n(compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added\nat 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds.\nData analysis:\nData were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a\ngiven trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in\nwhich antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the\nfluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in\nthe baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The slope of the fluorescence increase\nbeginning five seconds after thallium/agonist addition and ending fifteen seconds after\nthallium/agonist addition was calculated.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a tyrosine kinase involved in growth factor and integrin\nmediated signal transduction pathways.\n\nA homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) method to monitor the\nphosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate by FAK was used to screen for inhibitors. The\nprinciple of the assay is similar to other kinase detection systems utilizing TR-FRET, except this\nmethod utilizes a novel FRET acceptor dye, ULight, which is coupled by direct labeling to the\nsubstrate. The level of substrate phosphorylation by FAK activity is detected with a specific\neuropium-labeled anti-phospho-peptide antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon\nphosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to the phosphorylated tyrosines of the\nsubstrate brings the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, hence allowing FRET to occur. A\npotential inhibitor of FAK would prevent the proper phosphorylation of the substrate, hence\ndecreasing the FRET signal.\n\n2.5 microliters per well of a solution containing 2 nanomolar FAK enzyme in kinase buffer (50\nmillimolar HEPES, 10 millimolar MgCl2, 1 millimolar EGTA, 0.01% Tween , 2  millimolar DTT, final pH\n7.0) were dispensed into a 1536 black solid bottom non-treated microtiter plate. 35 nanoliters of\ntest compound (final nominal concentration of 7 micromolar, 0.7% final DMSO concentration) or\npositive and negative control (143 micromolar staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then added\nto the appropriate wells.

Plates were then incubated 30\nminutes at room temperature. After excitation at 340 nm, fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu)\nand 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (Perkin Elmer).   \nTo normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to\ncalculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: \nRatio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 \nWhere I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in\nnanometers.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:\n% Inhibition= (1-((Ratio Compound # Median_Ratio_HighControl)/(Median__Ratio_LowControl -\nMedian_Ratio_HighControl)))*100\nWhere: \nLowControl: DMSO\nHighControl: 1 micromolar staurosporine (staurosporine is a non-specific, yet potent kinase\ninhibitor; 1 micromolar corresponds to staurosporine IC100).\nA mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary\nscreen.

        bat:hasParagraph  "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are family A GPCRs comprised of five distinct mammalian subtypes\n(mAChR1-5 or M1-M5), which are expressed differentially throughout the body and play an important\nrole in a variety of physiological processes.  Among the mAChRs, M1 and M4 have been historically\nconsidered attractive targets for small molecule treatments of numerous CNS disorders such as\nAlzheimer's disease and schizophrenia due to their respective localization and involvement in\nregulation of certain aspects of learning, memory, sleep, motor control, reward, and pain, among\nothers.  However, discovery of subtype-selective small molecules has proven highly difficult due to\nthe conservation of the orthosteric binding-site across the mAChRs.  This has contributed to the\nfailure of muscarinic agonists in clinical trials and has also hampered pharmacological\ninvestigation into the role(s) of each mAChR in basic neurobiology.\nAmong the mAChRs, M5 has remained perhaps the most challenging to investigate pharmacologically due\nin part to its extremely low expression level and a complete lack of M5-selective ligands. \nInterestingly, studies using M5-KO mice suggest that M5 is the sole mediator of\nacetylcholine-induced cerebrovasodilation, which has led to the hypothesis that an M5 activator\nwould have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of cerebrovascular dementias and ischemic stroke. \nFurthermore, M5-KO mice show dramatically reduced reward responses to drugs of abuse, consistent\nwith its putative localization on midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic\npathways.  This suggests that M5 antagonism or negative modulation may have utility in treatment of\nillicit drug addiction and withdrawal.  Despite these and other related findings from M5-KO mice,\nthere remains a strong need for small molecule tools to probe M5 function and test M5-related\nhypotheses in order to advance the state of the mAChR research field and provide critical\nproof-of-concept studies for drug discovery aims.\nAssay Info: Membranes were prepared from M5-CHO cells according to a previously described protocol.  \nBinding reactions contained 0.09\nnM [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) (obtained commercially from Amersham), 15-20 ug of membrane\nprotein, and test compound (30 uM final) or vehicle, and Acetylcholine (13-point CRC from serial\ndilution) in a total volume of 500 ul assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4).\n 1 uM (final) atropine was used to determine non-specific binding.  The KD of [3H]-NMS was\ndetermined empirically to be 0.264 nM.  Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room\ntemperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm).  Reactions were stopped and\nmembranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1um pore size) using a Brandel\nharvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4).  Filter\nplates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter\n(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  True [3H]-NMS concentration was back-calculated after\ncounting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS used in the reaction.  ACh Ki in the presence and absence of test\ncompound (M5 PAM or vehicle) was determined by the Cheng-Prusoff equation.  For all assays,\nradioligand depletion was kept to approximately 10% or less.\nThe acetylcholine Ki in the presence of compound SID 85285486 was  10-fold lower than in the\npresence of vehicle alone. Therefore, the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active' and the 'Score' was\nassigned as '100'.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the larger herpesvirus\nfamily that consists of three subfamilies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an\nextremely prevalent human herpesvirus. Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell\ntypes that EBV infects, which are primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. Infection of both\ncell types is associated with a variety of proliferative disorders and cancers. Current treatments\nfor such malignancies are traditional chemotherapy, radiation-therapy, surgery, and if possible,\nrestoration of immune system function. Like all herpesviruses, EBV has mechanisms to evade the\nimmune system and maintain latency in the human host. A treatment directed specifically against EBV\ncould significantly improve patient care by limiting initial acute infection and spread of the\nvirus between cells. Currently there are no inhibitors that block the entry of EBV.\nEBV gH and gL proteins form a heterodimeric complex and are required for membrane fusion with all\nknown EBV-targeted cell types. gp42 is an EBV-encoded protein and is essential for EBV infection of\nB cells. In EBV, gH/gL forms a high affinity complex with gp42 prior to MHC class II binding and\nthe activation of membrane fusion. In B cell fusion, gp42 binding to gH/gL is required for fusion\nactivation. The central role of the EBV gH/gL protein in viral entry into both B cells and\nepithelial cells makes it an attractive target for the development of anti-viral inhibitors.\nTo discover novel small molecule inhibitors of EBV induced membrane fusion and entry, which act by\nblocking essential viral protein interactions, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP)\nbased assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction between the gH/gL protein\nwith a fluorescently labeled peptide derived from gp42 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step\nmix-and-measure method was achieved for analyzing gH/gL protein and gp42 interaction. gH/gL protein\nFP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 1536-well uHTS format with a\ndemonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z&#8242; factor of above 0.7. Because of its\nsimplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for ultra high-throughput screening in 1536\nwell format of small molecules that bind directly to EBV gH/gL and block EBV entry.\n\n\n1.Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40\n2.gH/gL protein\n3.gp42-36-81 peptide with an N-terminal fluorescein label (gp42-Flu)\nProcedure:\n1.

A cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated\nchannel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the EC10 NPY response or direct agonism by test\ncompound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate\ncyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and\nas a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential,\nwhich is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y1\npotentiator or agonist will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG\nchannel opening and therefore reduced probe fluorescence.\n\nThe Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95%\nrelative humidity (RH).

The\ncompounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were\ndeclared active in AID 862; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments\nentitled, \"Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition\" (PubChem\nAID 920).\nIn this assay inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line\ncell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for\ntheir ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated induction of STAT1::luciferase reporter\nactivity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in\nSTAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block\nIFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the\nluciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit\nSTAT1 activity are considered non-selective inhibitors.\n\nThe inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run\nsimultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media\n(DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of\npenicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity\n(RH).\nPrior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in\nphenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of well-mixed\ncell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay\nwas started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration)\nin DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (final nominal IC100\nconcentration of 300 uM, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO alone\n(0.6% final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95%\nRH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set\nas 100% activation) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. Plates were then incubated for\n4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite\nHTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room\ntemperature for 15 minutes.

The expression of\nboth genes is regulated by the heat shock response mediated by activation of heat shock\ntranscription factor which binds to the heat shock promoter element. We have performed a secondary\nscreen of the positives emanating from the NINDS primary screen using HeLa cells containing a human\nHsp70 promoter fused to the Luciferase reporter construct. Cells were exposed to a range of\nconcentrations from 1 to 10uM in replicate.\nScreen: Confluent cells were detached from five10cm tissue culture plates with 1ml 1X trypsin and\nwere re-suspended in 500ml assay medium (1:10 dilution). The cells were immediately seeded in 48\nwell plates (500ul per well) and were grown overnight at 37C. After 12 hrs, selected compounds were\nadded to reach a final concentration of 1uM or 10uM (diluted with assay medium by 1000X from the\n10mM stock solution in DMSO). Each plate also contained 5uM of CdCl2 induced and uninduced cells as\npositive and negative controls, respectively. The cells were incubated with the test compounds at\n37C for 12 hours. After incubation, the medium and compounds were aspirated from the wells,\nfollowed by 1 rinse/aspirate cycle with 1XPBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution. 200ul of lysis\nbuffer was added to each well and the plates were immediately frozen at -80C until the luciferase\nassay performed.For the luciferase assay, 100ul of a lysed sample (per well) and 400ul of the\nreaction buffer was combined in a luminometer tube. Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical\nLuminescence Laboratory) was used to add 100ul of the substrate buffer to the\nlysed-sample/reaction-buffer mixture and read the luciferase activity. \nCell Lines: HeLa human cells (ATCC #CCL-2) were stably transfected with heat shock promoter (hsp70\npromoter; -188 to +150)/luciferase reporter construct.

Cells were grown in 48well plates at 37C. \nAssay Medium: The assay medium used for drug induction was identical to the growth medium without\nthe G418 selection agent. \nAssay Buffer: Cells were lysed in 200ul of BLUC (25mM Tris/H3PO4, pH7.8/ 10mM MgCl2 / 1% Triton\nX-100/ 15% Glycerol/ 1mM EDTA) with 0.5% beta-mercaptoethanol. \nAssay Reagent: 400ul of BLUC (described above) with 1.25mM ATP was used for each luciferase\nreaction.Substrate buffer: 100ul of 1mM D-luciferin (Sigma #L-9504) in 1.4mM Tris/H3PO4, pH7.8 was\nused for each luciferase reaction. \nData Analysis: Each compound was tested in triplicate. The mean (Assay_Avg) and the standard\ndeviation (Assay_SD) were calculated using Microsoft Excel software. The fold induction\n(Assay_Final) was calculated by taking the ratio between the Assay_Avg and the average negative\ncontrol (uninduced) of the corresponding plate.

        bat:hasParagraph  "HTS to identify specific small molecule inhibitors of Ras and Ras-related GTPases.\n\nRas and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell\ngrowth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. \nThe Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies\nwith the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42)\nregulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf/Sar proteins regulating\nmembrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling\nnucleocytoplasmic transport. This project focuses on representative Ras, Rho, and Rab family\nmembers to validate the approach for the identification of new chemical compounds with novel\ntherapeutic potential in cell signaling and growth control.\nRas and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated, and dysregulation is causal in a wide\nvariety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane\nhyperactivation are linked to many human cancers. Point\nmutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting\npigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions. Rab and Rho mutants identified in\nhuman disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate\ncoupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and\nRas-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs\naffecting prenylation.\nGenerally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho\nproteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of\nthese prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members.\nRational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule\ninhibitors of Rho GTPase family members. Therefore, broadly\ntesting the Ras-related GTPases as targets for small molecule inhibitors and activators is expected\nto identify new classes of compounds that may be useful in the treatment of human disease, as well\nas in unraveling the molecular details of how Ras-related GTPases function.\nThe primary HTS assay was a no-wash fluorescent GTP-binding assay adapted to multiplexed,\nhigh-throughput measurements whereby multiple GTPases were simultaneously screened against the\nMLSCN library. The specificity is based on the observation that individual GTPases including wt and\nactivated forms exhibit measurably distinct affinities for Bodipy-FI-GTP vs GTP. The assay involves\nthe binding of fluorescent GTP to G protein-GST fusion proteins on GSH beads. A set of six G\nproteins (Rac 1 wt, Rab7 wt, Rac 1 activated, Ras wt, Rab 2 wt, Cdc42 wt) are arrayed under\nconditions of divalent molecule depletion. The primary screen was performed in 384-well format with\n194,656 compounds at a compound concentration of 10 microM to identify 398 potential small molecule\ninhibitors of each of these GTPases\nCompounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary screen (change in % activity greater\nthan 20% from baseline) were evaluated via dose response to confirm activity and determine potency.\n The active compounds from these dose responses were then used to develop structure activity\nrelationships for the different GTPases.  Here we report the activity of various compounds that\nwere purchased for SAR by commerce.  This collection of compounds does not represent a single\nparticular compound family, but rather is a combination of different compounds that were evaluated\nagainst different GTPase targets.\nBead sets are coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30mM\nHEPES pH 7.5; 100mM KCl; 20mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\ndegrees C, and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific,\nhave similar size (~ 4 microm diameter) however they are distinguished by varied magnitude of\nemission at 665 +/-10 nm with excitation at 635 nm.\nTest compounds were serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound\nconcentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10mM. These\ndilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nanoM to 100\nmicroM.\nThe assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5\nmicroliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200nanoM\nBodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of GTP of 100nanoM).\nPositive Controls, which contain bead mixture and fluorescent GTP but no test compound, are located\nin columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with fluorescent GTP and 0.5\nmM unlabeled GTP, are collected from a separate test tube. Plates are placed on rotators and\nincubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.  Dose response experiments reported here include one\nmultiplex format for: Rab7 wt, Rab2 wt, H-Ras wt, H-Ras constitutively active, Cdc42 wt, and Cdc42\nconstitutively active, and 2 single-plexes for: Rac1 wt and Rac1 constitutively active. \nSample acquisition and preliminary analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow\ncytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for\nhigh-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. \nThe stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow\ncytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nm (FL1) and emission at\n665 +/- 10 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved\nacquisition data file uses IDLeQuery/HyperView software to merge the flow cytometry data files with\ncompound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and\nside scatter (SS) parameters is used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8\nemission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) per bead population (well) is calculated. The raw data are parsed in\nIDLeQuery/HyperView to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data\nare then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to fit the\ndata via GraphPad Prism. \nCalculations:\nIn dose response experiments, the percent response was calculated for each GTPase target by the\nfollowing equation:\n%Response = (SampleMFI - NCntrl)/(PCntrl - NCntrl)\nwhere SampleMFI is the median fluorescence intensity of the compound sample, NCntrl is the median\nfluorescence intensity measured in the presence of access blocking non-fluorescent GTP, and PCntrl\nis the median fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of DMSO.  The %Response was 100% for\ncompounds not affecting the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP, and greater than 100% if the compound\nincreased the binding of Bodipy-FL-GTP and less than 100% if the compound decreased the binding of\nBodipy-FL-GTP.\nThe % response values for the entire concentration range of a test compound were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50,\nmicroM - concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding\nby 50 percent; LOGEC50 - the logarithm of EC50; TOP - the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\n- the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE - the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient;\nSTD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE - standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and\nHILLSLOPE ; EC50_95CI_LOW, EC50_95CI_HIGH - the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence\ninterval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR - the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of\ngoodness-of-fit.\nAssessment of the validity of the estimates from the Prism fits was filtered via the following\ncriteria:\n- -8 < LOGEC50 < -4 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)\n- STD_LOGEC50/|LOGEC50| <0.15 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be no greater than 15% of the\nabsolute value of LOGEC50)\n- 0.5 < |HILLSLOPE| < 2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than\n2)\nFor compounds with significant inhibitory affects (i.e., Hillslope < 0), Ki values were calculated\nfrom the EC50 values based on the following equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [Bodipy-FL-GTP]/Kd\nwhere [Bodipy-FL-GTP] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled GTP of 100 nanoM and Kd\nis the specific targets affinity for GTP.  In-house determination of the different Kds are as\nfollows: Rac wt 10.3 nanoM, Rab7 wt 7.0 nanoM, Cdc42 act 18.3 nanoM,  Cdc42 wt 26.8 nanoM, Ras wt\n18.5 nanoM, Rab2 wt 6.8 nanoM, Ras act 8.0 nanoM. Note that this equation is theoretically only\napplicable to dose response curves of absolute value of Hillslopes equal to 1, however the\ncalculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the Hillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM and the span of\nthe %Response is greater than or equal to 25%.  Span is the magnitude of %Response change over the\ntested concentration range based on either fitted values of TOP minus BOTTOM or from %Response\nvalues at lowest to highest concentration. \nAn active compound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0.\n" ;

This\nparticular assay uses the Jurkat cell line which is derived from human T cell leukemia.\n\nThe Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method to measure caspase-3 and caspase-7\nactivities in cultured cells. The quantitation of caspase 3/7 activity is based on the cleavage of\na peptide-aminoluciferin substrate. After caspase cleaves the substrate the free aminoluciferin is\nliberated and serves as the substrate of luciferase, which generates the light. The luminescent\nsignal is proportional to amount of caspase 3/7 activity present.\nUsing the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, the amount of caspase 3/7 activity was measured in the Jurkat cell\nline with complete culture medium following compound treatment for 16 hours. The assay was\nperformed in opaque white 1536-well plates. In the screen, tamoxifen and doxorubicin were used as\npositive controls. Library compounds were measured for their ability to cause the activation of\ncaspase 3/7 in the cell line, as reflected by an increase in luminescence signal, in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Data were normalized to the controls for basal activity (DMSO only)\nand 100% stimulation (100 uM tamoxifen). AC50 values were determined from concentration-response\ndata modeled with the standard Hill equation.\n" ;

The light signal is proportional to PLpro activity. As designed,\ncompounds that act as PLpro inhibitors will prevent PLpro-mediated substrate deubiquitination and\ncleavage, thus preventing release of aminoluciferin, leading to no increase in well luminescence.\nCompounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal\nconcentration of 60 micromolar.\n\nPrior to the start of the assay, a mixture of PLpro peptide substrate and luciferase detection\nreagent was made up in assay buffer (50mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM\nMagnesium sulfate) at pH 7.5 and incubated for 60 min.

In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with\na cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of\nisoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific\nbeta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is\nmeasured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP\nproduction or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence,\nthus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal\nconcentration of 3.6 uM.\nProtocol Summary:\nThe HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and\n95% relative humidity (RH).

The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x\nconcentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature\nfor 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm\nexcitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of 0.1%\nBSA was dispensed to all wells.

In\nthis assay, cells have been stimulated with the S1P agonist, which stimulates the S1P2 receptor,\nhence increasing BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents\nactivation by exogenously added S1P. Therefore, in the presence of a potential S1P2 antagonist,\ntranscription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence\nresonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.\nAs designed, test compounds that act as S1P2 antagonists will inhibit BLA transcription and\ncleavage of the fluorogenic substrate, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested\nin triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25\nmicromolar.\nProtocol Summary:\nCells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 deg C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth\nmedia consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated\ndialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2\nmg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to\nassay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in assay media, which\nconsisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2%\ncharcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM\nL-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). \nThe assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well\nplate (5000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate\nwells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar,\nfinal DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly\nafterwards by 1 microliter of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 750 nanomolar, i.e. a\nconcentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control\n(100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37\ndeg C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was\nprepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 microliter of this mixture was then added\nto each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the\nEnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405\nnm and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm.\nPrior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting \"background\" for both emission channels\n(ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize\nassay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the\nfollowing mathematical expression:\nRatio = I460 nm/ I535 nm\nWhere:\nI represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength.\nThe percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows:\n% Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / (\nMedian_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) )\nWhere:\nTest_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P,\nLow_Control is defined as wells containing S1P,\nHigh_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only.\nFor each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four\nparameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable\nbaseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were\ngenerated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of\nthe Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not\nresult in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25\nmicromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive.

        bat:hasParagraph  "The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a\nhigh-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR.  The assay was\nperformed in a #duplex# format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat\nBasophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1.  The FPR-expressing\ncells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the\nFPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the\nlysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that\nbound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to\nFPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the\nfluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.\n\nThe FPR primary HTS assay was performed in 384 well format.  Test compounds were assessed at a\nsingle concentration of 6.7 microM for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected\nas a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPR.  \nThe FPRL1 primary HTS assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported\nseparately and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of\ncompounds with FPR binding activity identified in this report.\n\nFor assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and\ncontrol reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines \n(10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5\nmicroL/well).  After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed\nby flow cytometry.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing\nunlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).   fMLFF (4Pep)\nwas used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide.  \nThe assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence\nand the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput\nflow cytometry platform was used to sequentially\nsample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation\nat a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery\nsoftware to determine compound activity in each well.\nTest compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as:\n%Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)]\nin which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells\ncontaining test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of\ncells in negative control wells, respectively.\nActivity Scoring\nTest compounds resulting in a mean inhibition of greater than 30% were considered active.  The\nactivity scores of the active compounds were calculated as:\nActivity Score = 100 x (%Inhibition - %Inhib_Min) /  (%Inhib_Max - %Inhib_Min)\nin which %Inhib_Min and %Inhib_Max were 30 and 100, respectively.  The calculated number was\nrounded up to the next higher integer value to obtain the final reported score.\nAn activity score of 0 was assigned to all compounds with %Inhibition of 30 or less.\n" ;

        bat:hasParagraph  "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that\nmodulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is\na result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a\nparticular subunit of G protein (Galpha).\nFollowing activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange,\nand subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active\nGTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream\nintracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is\ndetermined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg.\nGilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5\nper minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This\ndiscrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS\nproteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP\nhydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. \nThus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream\nregulation of GPCR signaling events. Since GPCRs control numerous physiologic processes in diverse\ntissues, including brain, heart, liver, and lung, modulation of the RGS/G protein interaction has\nbecome an attractive target for drug discovery. Assays based on RGS binding to fluorescently\nlabeled Galpha have recently been described in which immobilized RGS proteins are incubated with\nlabeled Galpha. Here we describe a further modification of this basic design\nwhere an AlexaFluor-488 conjugated Galphao (AF-Galphao) is incubated with RGS proteins that are\nimmobilized onto microspheres. Binding interactions between AF-Galphao and RGS is subsequently\nassessed by flow cytometer. This design provides the basis for development of fluorescence-based\nassays amenable to high throughput flow cytometry screening. We have multiplexed this assay using\ndifferentially labeled microspheres and used it to identify small molecule regulators of the\nRGS-Galphao interaction using the following 5 RGS family members: RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS16, and\nRGS19. \nProtocol used for the dose response assay is similar to the one used for screening, with the\nexception that compounds were tested at 9 different concentrations.  Each component of the\nmultiplex assay consists of a streptavidin functionalized polystyrene bead, a biotinylated\nRGS-fusion protein target (bio-RGS, five total, supplied by project collaborator), and a\nfluorescent probe, AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao protein. Six bead sets are used, including one\nunlabeled bead set and five sets that are labeled to different intensities with red fluorescence\nthat are fluorescent in APC-Cy7 (FL9, 750 nanom LP) channel at 635 nanom excitation (Spherotech\nproduct numbers SVPAK-5067-5B). Individual bead sets are coupled with a single bio-RGS protein by\nmixing beads and bio-RGS in bead coupling buffer (BCB; PBS, pH8.0 supplemented with 0.1% BSA). The\nmixture is then incubated overnight at 4oC under mild vortexing. The 5 bead sets (each with a bound\nprotein) and an uncoated bead set (Scavenger beads, see below) are centrifuged separately, washed\nonce in BCB, followed by another wash in flow buffer (FB; 50 milliM HEPES, 100 milliM NaCl, 0.1%\nLubrol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 8.0). The bead sets are then resuspended in FB and stored on ice until the\nplates are assembled using the Biomek FXp, Automated work station. Before incubation with\nbead-coupled RGS proteins, AF-Galphao is incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in AMF buffer\n(50 milliM MgCl2, 50 microM AlCl3, 50 milliM NaF, 10 milliM GDP in FB). This incubation produces\nthe activated AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4-complex that binds RGS proteins with high affinity.\nAfter preparation, the bio-RGS coupled bead sets and the uncoated Scavenger bead set are further\ndiluted in FB, combined and loaded into 384-well microplates using the Biomek liquid handling\nworkstation. The assay is conducted in 384-well microplates in a total assay volume per well of\n10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture containing ~3,000 beads from each bead set, 0.1\nmicroliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 14 nanoM AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 in FB). Final assay\nconcentration of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 is 7 nanoM. The test compounds are arranged in serial\ndilutions of 1:3 starting at 30 microM concentrations and ending at 9 nanoM. Controls, which\ncontain the same bead mixture and AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 but no test compound, are located in columns\n1 and 2 of each plate (Positive Control Beads). Plates are incubated under mild vortexing for 30-90\nminutes at room temperature.\nSpecificity of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 binding is determined with a Negative Control using mixture of\nblank (no RGS) red color-coded streptavidin bead sets because there are no known universal blocking\npeptides for all 5 RGS proteins. The AF-Galphao Negative Control is run daily as a separate single\ntube assay by incubating the blank bead sets in 7 nanoM of AF-Galphao-GDP-AlF4 under mild vortex\nfor 30-90 min. \nSample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) high throughput flow cytometry platform. The\nHyperCyt(R) system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput\nmicroliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates. Flow cytometric\ndata of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530 +/- 20 nanom (FL1) and 750+ nanom (FL9) are\ncollected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Time-resolved data is acquired as a single data file\nthat is subsequently analyzed using HyperView(R) software (software developed inhouse by Dr. Bruce\nEdwards) that merges flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip\nsoftware. The raw data are parsed to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The\nparsed data are then processed through a Microsoft Excel template file, constructed specifically\nfor the assay, which segregates data from each RGS-target protein and the fluorescence scavenger in\nthe multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters is used to\nidentify singlet bead populations. Additional gating based on FL9 (red) emission distinguishes the\nbeads coated with different proteins. Per bead population, the median channel fluorescence (MCF)\nfrom FL1 (green) channel is calculated for analysis of AlexaFluor488-labeled Galphao binding.\nCalculations:\nIn order to get a significant measurement of a compound's effect on a particular RGS protein, 25\nbeads with that particular protein bound needs to be collected from a well. When less than 25 beads\nare counted, the result for that protein is considered missing. Compounds from missing wells are\ngiven a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 4 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE =0.\nWhen the measured emission is potentially attributed to the innate fluorescence of the compound,\nthese compounds are flagged as \"Possible_Fluorescent_Compound\" (see column titled\nPUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT). Assessment of fluorescence is made by comparing the influence of\ncompound fluorescence on the scavenger beads in one well. In the presence of fluorescent compound,\npercent response of Scavenger at 30 microM was greater than 250%.\nPercent response is calculated per plate basis for each compound concentration by the following\nequation: \n%Response = 100 x (SampleFL-NCntrl)/(PCntrl-NCntrl)\nwhere all variables are in units of median channel fluorescence (MCF) in FL1 (530 nanom) associated\nwith the protein-coupled bead set. PCntrl is the plate average of wells with DMSO, and NCntrl is\nfrom the measurement non-specific AF-labeled Galphao binding in absence of RGS protein. Baseline of\n%Response is 100, and represents a test compound that has no effect on the RGS-Galphao binding.  A\ncompound with activating effects would have %Response greater than 100 and a compound with\ninhibitory effects would have %Response less than 100.\nThe %Response data of duplicate values from each compound concentration were fitted by Prism(R)\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a\nsigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic\nequation. Curves were fitted for both activators and inhibitors, thus fit statistics were used to\ndetermine the concentration of added test compound that effected fluorescent ligand binding by 50\npercent (EC50, microM) with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated EC50 value, Hillslope, and\nthe correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit. For compounds with\nsignificant inhibitory affects, Ki values were calculated from the EC50 values based on the\nfollowing equation:\nKi = EC50/(1 + [AF-Galphao]/Kd\nwhere [AF-Galphao] is the assay concentration of fluorescently labeled Galphao of 7 nanoM and Kd is\nthe specific targets affinity for Galphao. For RGS4 that value had been determined to be 40 nanoM.\nNote that this equation is theoretically only applicable to dose response curves of absolute value\nof Hillslopes equal to 1, however the calculations of Ki's reported did not take into account the\nHillslope.\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE were calculated based on an EC50 cutoff of 30 microM, by using the following\nequations:\nSCORE = 100*(1-EC50/30 )\nAnd compounds were demeaned active if the EC50 is equal to or less than 30 microM.  Thus an active\ncompound have a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 0 and the type of active compound (Activator or\nInhibitor) is listed in column 'RESPONSE_TYPE'.\n" ;
