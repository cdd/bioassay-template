# CheckStyle

This directory contains the tools necessary to run the [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) tool, using a set of rules that are designed for the Java coding style used for BAE and related projects (which is an [Allman-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style) variant).

To run it from the main path on the whole source directory:

`check/run src`
